<h1 id="sec:related">Background and Literature</h1>
<p>This chapter discusses the background and literature of the various fields that inform this research. Given the interdisciplinary history of HCI research, and the socio-economic domain of non-profit enterprise, it should come of no surprise that this results in a rich and diverse nexus of perspectives which needs to be accounted for.</p>
<h2 id="charities-what-are-they-good-for">Charities, what are they good for?</h2>
<p>This section explores Charities and Non-Profit Organisations (NPOs); how they are defined, and what role they play in society. This is done for two reasons: firstly, to explore the ecosystems, landscapes, and settings within which these organisations operate so that the research is effective; and secondly, to ground the work’s relevance as playing a part in the mundane activities of the world.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-a-charity">What is a Charity?</h3>
<p>Defining what constitutes a charity can be problematic because it is a specific form of organisation that belongs to an entire sector or family of organisations which have historically resisted definition. This is largely due to the sheer diversity of both the organisations themselves as well as the legal and social frameworks in which they operate. Even choosing which term to use is problematic not only because any given term can emphasise particular traits of organisations or exclude some organisations entirely, but choosing what term to use will give any discussion a particular national flavour. For example, the term ’Charity Sector’ is often used in the UK whereas framing this discussion using the term of ’Non-Profit Organisations’ (NPOs) makes it feel distinctly relevant to the USA. However, as noted, these organisations all share a genealogy, which means utilising literature that in turn uses a variety of terms to describe this group of organisations. A working definition of ’a charity’ will be outlined at the end of this section.</p>
<p>Charities are a form of Non-Profit Organisation (NPO) which operate within what is often known as the “Third Sector” of the economy; emphasising their separation for public or state-owned operations as well as private for-profit enterprise. The term ’Third Sector’, however, is often used interchangeably with others such as “Voluntary Sector”, “Independent Sector”, “Charitable Sector”, or many others. Salamon and Anheier claim that this abundance of definitions often poses a problem, as each term emphasises a particular characteristic of these organisations whilst downplaying others – which can be misleading when attempting to describe them. An example of this would be how the term “Voluntary Sector” emphasises the contributions of volunteers in the operation of the organisations, at the expense of organisations or activities that are performed by paid employees. Frumkin prefers the term “Non-Profit and Voluntary Sector” for this reason.</p>
<p>This diversity of organisations within the “Third Sector” means that a general definition is difficult to generate, however Salamon and Anheier go some way to provide one based off of the structural or operational characteristics of the organisations; which would therefore allow their definition to cater for the sector’s diversity of legal structures, funding mechanisms, and function. Their definition identifies five base characteristics common to the organisations (they use the term NPOs). These organisations are: “Formal”, having been constituted or institutionalised legally to some extent; “Private”, meaning they are institutionally separate from government; “Non-Profit distributing”, where any profits generated by activities are reinvested directly into the ’basic mission of the agency’ instead of being distributed to owners or directors; “Self-governing”, with their own internal protocols or procedures as opposed to being controlled directly by external entities; and “Voluntary”, where the organisation’s activities or management involves a meaningful degree of voluntary participation.</p>
<p>Frumkin gives three characteristics of these organisations which align with Salamon and Anheier’s framework. The organisations: do not coerce participation (ie they do not have a monopoly and interacting with them is optional); their profits are not given to stakeholders; and they lack clear lines of ownership and accountability. These definitions are not without issue, as they notably exclude various quasi-commercial entities such as those found in the UK – ie Building Societies and Cooperatives.</p>
<p>It is the exclusion of such entities that presents an issue for achieving a working definition. Lohmann calls for a more expansive view of the “Nonprofit Organisation” since definitions often account only for those legally bound by particular legislation and that if academics work only within these confines then they are limited in their attention. Lohmann also takes issue with the term “Third Sector” as it often is not presented in context of what it is a sector of. Lohmann argues that the organisations generally included in definitions of the “Third Sector” are actually simply a part of a broader grouping termed the “Social Economy” which would include NPOs and Charities but also others such as cooperatives and member organisations. Moualert and Ailenei elaborate that the term “Social Economy” is tied with notions of economic redistribution and reciprocity, and argue that a “one-for-all” definition is not useful to produce, as the organisations within the Social Economy are driven by local contexts. They put forward that the Social Economy as a practice, as well as the institutions that make it up, are linked to periods of crisis – and that the Social Economy is a method to respond to the alienation and dissatisfaction of people’s needs by the For-Profit and State sectors at any given time. Monzon and Chaves go into detail about defining the characteristics of organisations that make up the Social Economy, largely echoing the definitions for the US-centric “NPOs” discussed earlier. In addition to this is their elaboration that “[the organisations] pursue an activity in its own right, to meet the needs of persons, households, or families … [They] are said to be organisations of people, not of capital … They work with capital and other non-monetary resources but not for capital.” This indicates that the unifying characteristic of these organisations is their concern for people, and begins to define them based on what they are rather than the via negativa of “Third Sector”.</p>
<p>In the UK, the term ’Charity’ is protected and has a specific definition enshrined in law. According to UK law, a Charity is an organisation that is “established for charitable purposes only”, where the Charities Act then later defines a list of charitable purposes to ensure that the organisation is acting for the public benefit. These cover a wide variety of purposes and such as “the prevention or relief of poverty” and “the advancement of citizenship or community development”. Whilst this mirrors the Monzon and Chaves assertion that organisations pursue activity to “meet the needs of persons…”, it is the opinion of this thesis that enshrinement in law is not necessary treat an organisation as a charity for the purposes of research. This is so that any outcomes of the research can be applied to intenational contexts – where different legal definitions of the word “Charity” may exist. To that end, our definition of a charity going forward takes the common threads discussed in this section that Charities are: non-for-profit organisations that are legally distinct from government; are set up towards a charitable purpose (regardless of whether that purpose is enshrined in law); and that a citizen’s interactions with the organisation are voluntary.</p>
<h3 id="why-are-charities-important">Why are Charities Important?</h3>
<p>As noted, the activities of NPOs are incredibly diverse. Salamon states that NPOs <span><em>“deliver human services, promote grass-roots economic development, prevent environmental degradation, protect civil rights and pursue a thousand other objectives formerly unattended or left to the state”</em></span>, an insight which admittedly barely begins to describe the wide scope of NPO activity, and speaks to a larger issue surrounding misleading classifications and discussions of the organisations themselves <span class="citation">Salamon (1994; Salamon and Anheier 1992)</span>. In further discussion of NPO classification, Salamon and Anheier state <span><em>“No single classification system is perfect for all possible purposes”</em></span>, but attempt to explain NPO activities through developing a system known as the <em>International Classification of Nonprofit Organisations (ICNPO)</em>; which classifies NPOs into 12 groups based on economic activity, with an additional 24 sub-groups <span class="citation">Salamon and Anheier (1992)</span>. The resulting classifications themselves are very high-level, with groups such as <em>Health</em> and <em>Social Services</em>, but the sub-groups begin to hint at the type of activities NPOs engage e.g. <em>Nursing Homes</em>, and <em>Income support and maintenance</em> <span class="citation">Salamon and Anheier (1992)</span>. Hansmann writes on the role of NPOs that they often emerge from a <span><em>“contract failure”</em></span> of the market to police the producers of services, and very rarely exist in industrial sectors <span class="citation">Hansmann (1980)</span>. According to Hansmann, economic theory dictates that the ability of consumers to: accurately compare providers; reach agreement as to the price and quality of service to be exchanged; and assess the compliance of the organisation to their part of the deal and obtain redress if the organisation has not complied <span class="citation">Hansmann (1980)</span>. The services offered by NPOs often involve a separation between the purchaser of a service and the recipient (e.g. the purchase and transport of food stuffs overseas), and the inability of NPOs to distribute profits to shareholders removes the incentive (and power) of organisations to reduce direct spend on the service provided – <span><em>“The reason is simply that contributors [to a for-profit business] would have little or no assurance that their payments to a for-profit station were actually needed to pay for the service they received”</em></span> <span class="citation">Hansmann (1980)</span>. Mendel and Brudney discuss the relationship between NPOs and <em>Public Value</em>, claiming that its creation is <span><em>“philanthropy at its best”</em></span> <span class="citation">Mendel and Brudney (2014)</span>. King elaborates on the role of NPOs as</p>
<h3 id="what-are-the-challenges-of-charities-today">What are the challenges of Charities today?</h3>
<p>Traditionally, NPOs have embraced values such as philanthropy and voluntarism in order to advocate for, and to provide the means for, services to their client-base <span class="citation">Alexander and Weiner (1998)</span>. Social Enterprise and Social Entrepreneurship have risen as a response to these challenges faced by NPOS today <span class="citation">Dart (2004)</span>. Dart broadly describes Social Enterprise as <span><em>“significantly influenced by business thinking and by a primary focus on results and outcomes for client groups and communities”</em></span> <span class="citation">Dart (2004)</span>, Dees states that Social Enterprise <span><em>“combines the passion of a social mission with an image of business-like discipline”</em></span> <span class="citation">Dees and others (1998)</span>. In practice, this often includes activities and practices that include revenue-source diversification, fee-for-service programs, and partnerships with the private sector <span class="citation">Dart (2004)</span>. Social Enterprise, whilst often regarded as a miracle solution <span class="citation">Dart (2004; Harding 2004; Dees and others 1998)</span>, is not without criticism. Eikenberry writes that NPOs, focusing on bottom-line expenditure and adopting a social enterprise model actually poses a threat to civil society <span class="citation">Eikenberry and Kluver (2004)</span>. She argues that the on the bottom line and overhead expenditures forcing NPOs to embrace market values and entrepreneurial attitudes, and changing the way that they operate has been detrimental. Dart claims that Social Enterprise differs traditional NPOs as they generally <span><em>“blur boundaries”</em></span> between nonprofit and for-profit activities, and even enact <span><em>“hybrid”</em></span> activities <span class="citation">Dart (2004)</span>. This could include activities such as engaging with marketing contracts as opposed to accepting donations, as well as behaviour such as cutting services that are not deemed to be cost-effective <span class="citation">Eikenberry and Kluver (2004)</span>. Implications of industry funded NPOs notwithstanding <span class="citation">Jacobson (2005)</span>, the shift of effort from effective service delivery to financial strategy impacts negatively on the social capital that is generated. This is through less emphasis on building relationships with stakeholders (previously an essential survival strategy) as service users become framed as consumers, and through market pressures diverting resources towards skills such as project management and away from activities that build social capital <span class="citation">Eikenberry and Kluver (2004)</span>. Doherty et al. echo this in their description of Social Enterprises, distinguishing them from traditional NPOs by stating that the latter are <span><em>“more likely to remain dependent on gifts and grants rather than developing true paying customers”</em></span> <span class="citation">Doherty et al. (2006)</span>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><span><em>“Nowhere, therefore, does transparency get more problematic than in financial reporting for public companies. Going back as far as the 1600s, financial reporting scandals have been the most visible and far-reaching examples of hidden information and outright fraud”</em></span> - Richard Oliver, <em>What is Transparency? (2004)</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Transparency and Accountability are seen increasingly desirable in governments and organisations <span class="citation">Hood (2010; Oliver 2004; Heald 2003)</span>. Oliver states that Transparency has <span><em>“moved over the last several hundred years from an intellectual ideal to center stage in a drama being played out across the globe in many forms and functions”</em></span> <span class="citation">Oliver (2004)</span>. Corrêa et al. say Transparency and Open Government is <span><em>“synonymous with efficient and collaborative government”</em></span> <span class="citation">Correa et al. (2014)</span>, and Steele goes as far to say <span><em>“Transparency is the new ‘app’ that launches civilization 2.0”</em></span> <span class="citation">Steele (2012)</span>. Non-Profit Organisations (NPOs) in the UK are held to stringent Transparency standards by an organisation known as the Charity Commission, which is responsible for registering and regulating charities in England and Wales <span><em>“to ensure that the public can support charities with confidence”</em></span> <span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="hm_government_charity_????"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span>. The development of trust is foundational in the relationship between an organisation and those invested in its activities or performance, known as stakeholders, which is compounded by the notion that a stakeholder in an NPO might not be in direct receipt of its services <span class="citation">MacMillan et al. (2005; Krashinsky 1997)</span>. Beyond this, accountability is seen as a way of building legitimacy as an organisation <span class="citation">Anheier and Hawkes (2009)</span>. Watchdog organisations such as the Charity Commission and others therefore play an important role in developing stakeholder relationships with NPOs through Transparency measures, making them accountable to those invested in them. Oliver writes that NPO expenditure is often the <span><em>“most emotional”</em></span>, and a person’s decision to invest in a charity will be down to how comfortable and confident they are in its operation <span class="citation">Oliver (2004)</span>.</p>
<p>Hood writes that <span><em>“Transparency is more often preached than practised [and] more often invoked than defined”</em></span> <span class="citation">Hood (2006)</span>. This section considers various definitions of Transparency in relation to the UK Charity Commission, NPOs, and the measures that are taken to make them accountable to stakeholders. It also inspects Transparency’s synonymity with Accountability.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-transparency">What is Transparency?</h3>
<p>Historically, Transparency was inherent in the actions and interactions of everyday society since, in traditional societies, the density of social networks made one’s actions highly visible <span class="citation">Meijer (2009)</span>. Meijer contrasts this with modern societies where <span><em>“people do not know each other – many people in cities do not even know their neighbors”</em></span> and argues that societies which operate at a larger scale suffer a decline in social control, which calls for new forms of Transparency that match the scale of the society <span class="citation">Meijer (2009)</span>.</p>
<p>Transparency has been a watch-word for governance since the late 20th century, yet its roots stretch back much further. In a discussion of Transparency’s historical context, Hood identifies three ‘strains’ of pre-20th-century thought that are at least partial predecessors to Transparency’s modern doctrine: rule-governed administration; candid and open social communication; and ways of making organisation and society ‘knowable’ <span class="citation">Hood (2006)</span>.</p>
<p>Rule-governed administration is the idea that government should operate in accordance to fixed and predictable rules and, and Hood calls it the <span><em>“one of the oldest ideas in political thought”</em></span> <span class="citation">Hood (2006)</span>. Early proponents of candid and open discussion liken transparency to one’s natural state, and it saw an implementation in the ‘town meeting’ method of governance where members of the town would deliberate in the presence of one another – making all deals transparent and ensuring all parties were mutually accountable <span class="citation">Hood (2006)</span>. The third of Hood’s ‘strains’ of proto-Transparency doctrines, is the notion of making the social world ‘knowable’; largely through methods or techniques that act as counterparts to studying natural or physical phenomena. Hood describes an 18th-century <span><em>“police science”</em></span> which exposed the public to view through the introduction of street lighting or open spaces, as well as the publication of information (all of which designed to help prevent crime) <span class="citation">Hood (2006)</span>.</p>
<p>Heald describes modern Transparency as directional; with the direction of the Transparency indicating who is visible, and to whom <span class="citation">Heald (2006)</span>. Transparency, according to Heald, has four directions on two planes: upwards and downwards; inwards and outwards. <em>Upwards</em> Transparency indicates that those higher in a hierarchy can observe the conduct, behaviour, or results of those below – whilst <em>Downwards</em> Transparency is the means by which those lower in a hierarchy can observe those above them. In a similar dichotomy, <em>Outwards</em> Transparency is used to describe how an organisation can see ‘outside’, to either understand habitat or monitor peers and competitors. Situations where those external to an organisation can observe what’s happening inside are described as examples of <em>Inwards</em> Transparency <span class="citation">Heald (2006)</span>. These can (and often do) coexist as any combination of the four i.e. having <em>Upwards</em> Transparency does not preclude the existence of its counterpart, <em>Downwards</em> Transparency, and when the two coexist there is a symmetry on that plane (vertical or horizontal) <span class="citation">Heald (2006)</span>.</p>
<p>The combination of <em>Downwards</em> and <em>Outwards</em> Transparencies could be said to describe a form of surveillance, where employers can monitor their workers or a government can monitor the activities of its citizens <span class="citation">Heald (2006)</span>. The inverse, <em>Upwards</em> and <em>Inwards</em>, implies a form of <em>Sousveillance</em> – a term coined by Steve Mann meaning <span><em>“to watch from below”</em></span> <span class="citation">Mann (2004)</span>. Mann gives two possible interpretations of <em>Sousveillance</em>, the first being the relative positions of the cameras in physical and social space (e.g. cameras on phones), with the other being an inversion of hierarchical surveillance and a close match to Heald’s descriptions of <em>Upwards</em> Transparency, where the citizen can peer into an organisation <span class="citation">Mann (2004; Heald 2006)</span>. Sousveillance is often discussed in the context of citizens capturing abuses of power at street-level by trusted entities such as: police officers; security personnel; or similar entities, but Ganascia also discusses how an increased desire for access to public information has lead to aspirations for <span><em>“total transparency”</em></span>, which in the US has resulted in governmental endorsement of data sharing (often called <em>Open Government</em> or <em>Government 2.0</em>) <span class="citation">Ganascia (2010)</span>. There have been similar moves in the UK (e.g. data.gov.uk) which are designed to improve the delivery and accountability of public services <span class="citation">Shadbolt et al. (2012)</span>.</p>
<p>An example of this from UK would be the presence of the Charity Commission, which enforces transparency measures that are applied to NPOs. Schauer writes of Transparency that for information, or processes, to qualify as transparent they must be <span><em>“open and available for scrutiny”</em></span> <span class="citation">Schauer (2011)</span>. This notably lacks an explanation of who can take advantage of transparent information, and at what cost to them. Transparency, according to Schauer, cannot be equated with knowledge; at best it facilitates it <span class="citation">Schauer (2011)</span>. Hood similarly acknowledges this as an area of tension between the <span><em>“town meeting”</em></span> form of Transparency, and its distant cousin concerned with accounting and book-keeping <span class="citation">Hood (2006)</span>. Oliver echoes this sentiment, describing Transparency as a journey in contrast to a destination <span class="citation">Oliver (2004)</span>.</p>
<p>Data released pertaining to resource allocation is an example of what Heald describes as <em>Input Transparency</em>, which is easily measurable but doesn’t necessarily address the link between this input and any outcome <span class="citation">Heald (2003; Heald 2006)</span>. An NPO’s nature as <em>not-for-profit</em> additionally compounds the issues with using this data, since “bottom-line” measurements cannot be used, and allocation of funds to an activity or project doesn’t indicate whether it is under, or over, funded <span class="citation">Henderson, Chase, and Woodson (2002)</span>. Oliver states that, where stakeholders are concerned, transparent communication involves <span><em>“focusing on more than just the traditional numbers, such as financial data, customer statistics, and operational metrics”</em></span>, and that discussions of the stakeholders <span><em>“value drivers”</em></span> should be had, and that they should be <span><em>“accurate and understandable”</em></span> <span class="citation">Oliver (2004)</span>. This forms part of a grander move, alluded to by Oliver and Schauer, away from <em>Old Transparency</em> (Oliver) or <em>Passive Transparency</em> (Schauer) and towards newer and more engaging forms of transparent practice.</p>
<p>Transparency in government and business has traditionally been a relatively passive affair, equating to the provision of data without particular concern to its promotion or interpretation <span class="citation">Schauer (2011; Oliver 2004)</span>. Even various ‘Freedom of Information’ (FOI) Acts around the world, require that public companies provide information <em>on request</em> but do not stipulate the format required – and Worthy claims that whilst the UK Act has succeeded in making the government more transparent, it is not more trusted <span class="citation">Hood (2006; <span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="_freedom_2000"><strong>???</strong></span>; Worthy 2010)</span>. This attitude is summed up by Oliver as <span><em>“letting the truth be available to others to see if they so choose, or perhaps think to look, or have the time, means and skills to look”</em></span> <span class="citation">Oliver (2004)</span>. Societal factors such as the prevalence of information technology and media scrutiny have helped develop a movement towards more active forms of Transparency, called <em>New Transparency</em> by Oliver and <em>Active Transparency</em> by Schauer <span class="citation">Oliver (2004; Schauer 2011)</span>. These newer forms of Transparency are more concerned with the <span><em>“active disclosure”</em></span> of information by organisations, seeing Transparency itself as an act of communication concerned with the organisation’s responsibilities <span class="citation">Schauer (2011; Oliver 2004)</span>.</p>
<p>Modern information technologies play an important role in defining transparency, Meijer claims <span><em>“Modern transparency is computer-mediated transparency”</em></span> <span class="citation">Meijer (2009)</span>. A key characteristic in <span><em>“Computer-mediated Transparency”</em></span> is that it shifts the direction of transparency from a two-way interaction such as in face-to-face interactions to a one-way interaction such as viewing data on a web page <span class="citation">Meijer (2009)</span>. Meijer gives the example of citizens attending council meetings – they can interrogate the councillors, but the councillors could also see citizens who had attended, whereas now councils cannot see who visits their web pages <span class="citation">Meijer (2009)</span>.</p>

<h3 id="transparency-and-accountability">Transparency and Accountability</h3>
<p>The imposition of transparency measures is generally seen as tantamount to ensuring accountability of institutions, organisations, or individuals in power; and often the terms are used interchangeably <span class="citation">Fox (2007; Hood 2010)</span>. The two terms, however, are separate and have their own (if somewhat malleable) definitions <span class="citation">Fox (2007)</span>. Fox discusses accountability in terms of <span><em>“the capacity or right to demand answers”</em></span> or the <span><em>“capacity to sanction”</em></span>, whereas transparency concerns itself with the public’s right and ability to access information; and whilst common wisdom dictates that transparency generates accountability, this assumption is challenged when held to scrutiny <span class="citation">Fox (2007)</span>. Fox’s analysis of transparency divides it into two categories – <em>clear transparency</em> and <em>opaque</em> or <em>fuzzy transparency</em> – which closely resemble Schauer and Oliver’s definitions of the <em>Active</em> or <em>New Transparency</em> and the <em>Passive</em> or <em>Old Transparency</em> <span class="citation">Schauer (2011; Oliver 2004; Fox 2007)</span>. Fox argues the importance of this distinction lies in the fact that as Transparency becomes an increasingly desirable term, opponents will express their dissent through provision of <em>fuzzy transparency</em>. This is data which lacks information that can reveal organisational behaviour and thus cannot be used to generate accountability <span class="citation">Fox (2007)</span>. The <em>Clear Transparency</em> alluded to by Fox is defined as <span><em>“information-access policies [and] programmes that reveal reliable information about institutional performance, specifying officials’ responsibilities [and] where public funds go”</em></span>. Importantly, though <em>Clear Transparency</em> is concerned with organisational behaviour, it is not sufficient to generate accountability – which requires the intervention of other actors <span class="citation">Fox (2007)</span>. Accountability is also explained by Fox as either <em>Soft Accountability</em> (the ability to demand answers) and <em>Hard Accountability</em> (the ability to issue sanctions). Fox stipulates that appropriate levels of <em>Clear Transparency</em> gives the public the ability to perceive problems, and to demand answers – which is a form of <em>Soft Accountability</em> known as <em>answerability</em> <span class="citation">Fox (2007)</span>. Further forms of accountability are founded on the ability to not only reveal existing data, but to investigate and produce information about organisational behaviour <span class="citation">Fox (2007)</span>. Anheir and Hawkes reflect Fox’s sentiment in their discussion of Accountability, where they describe Accountability as a <span><em>“multi-dimensional concept that needs unpacking before becoming a useful policy concept and management tool”</em></span>, and note that in the case of trans-national organisations; Accountability itself is a problem, and not simply a solution <span class="citation">Anheier and Hawkes (2009)</span>. This discussion, whilst focusing on the difficulty of regulating accountability across national borders, has insight into the ways that transparency mechanisms may not be adequate for generating true accountability in NPOs. They highlight how it is often media companies that reveal ‘unethical behaviour’ to the public, rather than formal auditing bodies – an example from the UK would be how the NPO <em>Kid’s Company</em> experienced negative media coverage over their closure relating to alleged misuse of funds <span class="citation">Elgot (2015; Anheier and Hawkes 2009)</span>. Anheir and Hawkes also draw on Koppel’s ‘Five Dimensions of Accountability’ framework – which imbues Accountability with a five-part typology: <em>transparency</em>; <em>liability</em>; <em>controllability</em>; <em>responsibility</em>; and <em>responsiveness</em> <span class="citation">Anheier and Hawkes (2009; Koppell 2005)</span>. Koppel avoids trying to produce a definitive definition of Accountability, stating <span><em>“[to layer] every imagined meaning of accountability into a single definition would render the concept meaningless”</em></span>, and the five-dimensional typology is instead designed to facilitate discussion of the term <span class="citation">Koppell (2005)</span>. Transparency features prominently in the typology, with Koppell referring to it as one of the <span><em>“foundations, supporting notions that underpin accountability in all of its manifestations”</em></span> alongside liability <span class="citation">Koppell (2005)</span>. Liability, according to Koppell, is the attachment of consequences to performance and culpability to Transparency – punishing organisations or individuals for failure, and rewarding them for successes <span class="citation">Koppell (2005)</span>. In this, the ‘foundational’ dimensions of Koppell’s typology are aligned with Fox’s definitions of Accountability which covers the capacity of demanding answers and to sanction, with Transparency as the ability to access the information in the first place <span class="citation">Koppell (2005; Fox 2007)</span>. The remaining three dimensions of Koppell’s typology: <em>controllability</em>; <em>responsibility</em>; and <em>responsiveness</em> are all built upon the foundations of Transparency and Liability. <em>Controllability</em> is a form of accountability where if <span><em>“X can induce the behaviour of Y [then] X controls Y [and] Y is accountable to X”</em></span> <span class="citation">Koppell (2005)</span>. Koppell notes that <em>Controllability</em> can be difficult in organisations that have multiple stakeholders to whom the organisation is supposed to be controlled by <span class="citation">(Koppell 2005)</span>. <em>Responsibility</em> denotes the constraint of behaviour through laws, rules, or norms such as legal frameworks or professional standards of conduct. <em>Responsiveness</em> in the typology describes the attention of an organisation to the needs of its clients, as opposed to the following of hierarchical orders <span class="citation">Koppell (2005)</span>. .</p>
<h2 id="how-can-digital-technologies-support-npo-transparency-and-accountability">How can digital technologies support NPO Transparency and Accountability?</h2>
<p>Transparency and Accountability can be said to be ultimately concerned with the sharing of information and the creation of pathways or mechanisms that allows stakeholders to act in accordance to it. Meijer argues that <span><em>“modern transparencies are computer-mediated”</em></span> <span class="citation">Meijer (2009)</span>, and Oliver goes as far to posit that digital technologies have sparked a self-sustaining <em>Information - Transparency Cycle</em> which is <span><em>“unstoppable”</em></span> and that information is now a commodity which is cheap to collect, organise, analyse, and distribute; the result of which is a reaction to missing information and a return to the collection phase <span class="citation">Oliver (2004)</span>. Similarly, Steele, in his <em>Open Source Everything Manfiesto</em> reflects on the ways in which the Internet has enabled the public to overcome previous restrictions on access to information and states, in no unclear terms, <span><em>“This bodes well for humanity”</em></span> <span class="citation">Steele (2012)</span>.</p>
<p>Models which support openness and public access to information has use cases that support its effectiveness as a tool for certain forms of Transparencies and Accountabilities. The Free Software movement and, to a lesser extent, the Open Source movement<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> have baked into their core the requirement for access to source code of software distributions; which is generally enforced through licensing code upon release in a particular way.</p>
<p>Camp frames the access to source of a given piece of software as a form of Transparency and Accountability <span class="citation">Camp (2006)</span>, a sentiment shared by various advocacy groups promoting end-user interaction with the software tools over proprietary alternatives <span class="citation">Pfaff and David (1998; Balter 2015)</span>. Camp outlines how that human-readable source code (specifically, source code that is not deliberately obfuscated) can be ’audited’ similar to to an ’open book’ form of transparency. Camp then transposes these concepts into governance processes; where ‘open’ code could be compared to digitised versions of an organisation’s governance processes. With an ‘open’ model, an organisation could be held to the same scrutiny as Open Source or Free Software source code <span class="citation">Camp (2006)</span>.</p>
<p>Free Software also demands a particular form of accountability through specific use-cases, namely that of programmers deriving work from it. Free Software is often released under ’restrictive’ or ‘copyleft’ licenses (e.g. <span class="citation">Foundation (2007)</span>) which legally enforce that derivative software, or new software including Free-licensed code as a component, is also released holistically as under the same license and thus under the same terms – enforcing access to the source. Stallman’s original GNU manifesto outlines the reasons why his GNU system employs a form of viral licensing: <span><em>“’Control over the use of one’s ideas’ really constitutes control over people’s lives; and it usually used to make their lives more difficult”</em></span> <span class="citation">Stallman and others (1985)</span>. In this, Stallman declares a unique form of accountability that can almost be seen as paradoxical – one that explicitly controls the actions of a particular group (programmers) in order to dictate that they relinquish control over another group (end-users access to and subsequent use of software tools).</p>
<p>Broadly, there are several strands of research into digital technologies that support interacting with information and data in this way; primarily these can be encapsulated within the areas of Open Data, and Human-Data Interaction (HDI) although the inter-disciplinary nature of HCI as a whole means that the subject matter naturally intersects or otherwise touches upon other research within the field. This section explores the potential and implications for how data may be produced and appropriated by charities and their stakeholders through a discussion around Open Data, Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) and Human-Data Interaction. It then turns to the pragmatic and investigates previous HCI research into previous examples pertaining to enabling interactions with finances</p>
<h3 id="interacting-with-data">Interacting with Data</h3>
<p>Open Data is <span><em>“data that anyone can access, use, or share”</em></span> <span class="citation">Institute (2016)</span>. It consists of organised data that is, generally, structured and placed online so that it can be consumed for use. Open Data can be produced, shared, and used by many people in many different contexts (e.g. scientific data sets, or government collection of environmental data). Often, it is parsed or processed in some way by digital technologies, and multiple datasets may also be combined in order to produce a desired insight for the stakeholder(s) consuming the data.</p>
<p>Human Data Interaction (HDI) is a coalescing field that is concerned with the social world of how people interact with data about themselves and others. Whilst it considers technical infrastructure surrounding data <span class="citation">McAuley, Mortier, and Goulding (2011)</span>, HDI also brings data’s role as a ‘Boundary Object’ <span class="citation">Star and Griesemer (1989)</span> to the fore and considers its role as a pervasive aspect of everyday life in terms of how to enable citizens to interact with this data in a more explicit fashion <span class="citation">Mortier et al. (2014)</span>.</p>
<p>A ‘Boundary Object’ is anything which may be recognised across different social ‘worlds’, yet may be appropriated and adapted by the needs of individuals and groups in a manner that pertains to their specific needs and context. Star and Griesemer describe Boundary Objects as <span><em>“both plastic enough to adapt to local needs ... yet robust enough to maintain a common identity across sites”</em></span> <span class="citation">Star and Griesemer (1989)</span> A good example of this is a receipt of purchase; it is inarguably a receipt, yet may be used by the bank to verify a purchase, by a store to prove that you own the items you’ve purchased, and proof that a transaction has occurred between your bank account and a store. Further to this, Crabtree and Mortier elaborate that Boundary Objects are “inherently social” and possess a “processual character” as part of the infrastructure of everyday life. To this end, they argue that Data is not so much an object in-and-of-itself but rather an object that is inherently embedded in human relationships <span class="citation">Crabtree and Mortier (2015)</span>.</p>
<p>Data’s use as a Boundary Object is demonstrated effectively by the rise in personal informatics. In the Quantified Self movement, individuals collect and process various forms and sources of data about them as individuals, generally for the purposes of recording progress towards various goals <span class="citation">Swan (2009; Swan 2013)</span>. Contrasting the movement’s general use of data as a pragmatic, goal-oriented object, Elsden et al demonstrate that data can be experienced by people in many ways and can serve different purposes such as providing playful ways to engage with each other and one’s own data <span class="citation">Elsden and Kirk (2014; Elsden, Nissen, et al. 2016)</span>. In particular, it is posited that data can offer an ‘alternative lens’ that other media does not, allowing people to view or represent an event in a different ways than originally envisioned and one that can be combined with other more traditional forms of documenting; and in doing so indicates that the record is always unfinalised and is continuously open to reinterpretation <span class="citation">Elsden et al. (2017)</span>.</p>
<p>Additionally, data as a Boundary Object has place within an organisational context, offering opportunities to use and present data in an exploratory context in people’s shared worlds. In an academic context (most UK Universities possess charitable status and thus belong to the Third Sector), visualising research funding across the institution was found to act as a means of supporting members of staff in understanding the funding landscape of the organisation and in communicating narratives to the outside world around perceived successes. The system (and by extension, its data) was also found to support the review and contestation of data when multiple interpretations were available, and Elsden et al explicitly note its implications for organisational transparency; with the caveat that a major design question raised by the research is whether contextualisation should occur merely through the data, or in conversation around it <span class="citation">Elsden, Mellor, et al. (2016)</span>.</p>
<p>As discussed, the presentation of information is not enough to engage in more modern forms of transparent practice; and the use of data (however nicely it may be visualised) is no exception to this and risks simply rehashing the older forms of transparency with faster production of data. Cornford et al write that the UK Government’s agenda of producing Open Government Data (OGD) fails to address the questions of how information is to be interpreted for local contexts; mirroring the concerns of Elsden et al around how data should be contextualised. Cornford et al argue that a wealth of open and structured data merely provides a ‘view from nowhere’ and that the true challenge lies in developing the interpretive communities that will utilise the information effectively <span class="citation">Cornford et al. (2013)</span>.</p>
<p>Some successes have been seen in the uses of OGD for engagement; the London Datastore <span class="citation">(“London Datastore – Greater London Authority” 2017)</span> collects, organises, and distributes a variety of Open Data pertaining to the City of London in the UK, and has seen great successes in terms of use-cases where developers and organisations have used data for service provision and governance purposes <span class="citation">Coleman (2013)</span>. In the US, journalists have begun utilising data to fuel their practice <span class="citation">Ramos (2013)</span>, and it has been argued that the proliferation of OGD has directly contributed to a ‘habit of engagement’ that in turn begins to develop a culture of civic participation through the use and responses to data about our civic world <span class="citation">Gordon and Baldwin-Philippi (2013a)</span>. Black and Burstein conceptualise a movement towards the ‘Twenty-First Century Town Hall’ <span class="citation">Black and Burstein (2013)</span> (possibly indicating a full circle movement to a more direct forms of Transparency discussed above) whereas Bloom postulates that OGD will form a new Commons resource <span class="citation">Bloom (2013)</span>.</p>
<p>Sense making and engagement stemming from the use of Open Data draws upon the field known as ‘Open-Source Intelligence’ (OSINT). Generally, OSINT concerns itself with the gathering of intelligence for problem solving from various public information sources <span class="citation">Bradbury (2011; Glassman and Kang 2012)</span>. This places it in contrast to other forms of intelligence-gathering which are generally performed using specialist or secret sources of information. Traditionally, this would look like utilising sources such as newspapers and public records but in the modern era sources such as Open Data and Social Media profiles may be used as viable sources of information to begin making steps towards solving intelligence problems <span class="citation">Bizer (2009)</span>.</p>
<p>The implications of an Open Data-fuelled OSINT for Transparency and Accountability are evident. As discussed, OSINT is concerned primarily with the application of information to solve issues or answer questions, so it stands to reason that an adequate data infrastructure would allow for (or even promote) engagement of stakeholders in OSINT for asking questions of charitable organisations (the ‘Habit of Engagement alluded to earlier <span class="citation">Gordon and Baldwin-Philippi (2013a)</span>). At the very least, such an infrastructure would enable the organisations to produce effective and interactive responses to queries around the performance of their work and their spending.</p>
<p>Steele discusses the power of OSINT at length. Coming from a position that “the only unlimited resource in the world is the human brain”, Steele puts forward that the engendering of Transparency via the production of Open Data, and the resultant OSINT practices, would lead to a systematic practice of exchanging information openly. This would then allow societal actors and stakeholders to evaluate and respond to complex problems. Whilst Steele refers directly to engagement with Governmental processes, this could see use in the Third Sector as well; when a charity could present information about their work within the context of complexity. A pragmatic example that might be most interesting for charities is the example of a ‘True Cost’ calculation – wherein the True Cost of a white cotton T-Shirt is outlined in economic, societal, and environmental terms.</p>
<p>In the context of charities, Erete et al explore how NPOs use Open Data technologies to support their practice through practices resembling OSINT. Data is largely used to create a narrative and engage in a story-telling practice around particular goals which differ in context – e.g. making grant applications, or internal management functions. Organisations are shown to combine multiple sources of data into a narrative, as well as being able to derive multiple narratives from a single data set. Further to this, they discuss how NPOs operate with limited resources and as such may benefit from services such as Data Portals to enable them to acquire data easily to produce these valuable narratives, and put forward that additional value is created via such portals when they act to build or strengthen relationships between those seeking to use the data and those possessing skills or knowledge around its analysis. From the perspective of Transparency and Accountability, it stands to reason that systems can be developed that allows charities (NPOs) to engage actively in the data collection process, and allow them to construct multiple, and varied narratives from personal data sets that can be used in similar contexts to those described by Erete et al – ie supporting grant applications and internal management procedures, but also additional cases such as evidencing their work by retrieving and presenting information collected about it.</p>
<p>In summation, it appears that digital technologies surrounding Open Data and its use as a Boundary Object have strong implications for the support of Charities in terms of Transparency and Accountability. Use of data has in the past demonstrated a usefulness in civic and academic contexts, supporting processes that are integral to Transparency (review and contestation), as well as potentially acting as a vector to allowing stakeholders to explore the complexities orbiting particular topics such True Cost, and therefore spending. With this in mind the discussion now turns to previous HCI work in the area of interacting with finances.</p>
<h3 id="how-do-digital-technologies-allow-people-to-interact-with-finances">How do digital technologies allow people to interact with finances?</h3>
<p>HCI research has previously concerned itself with investigating the ways in which can facilitate people’s interactions around money. Work has largely been focused on small scale interactions such as those found at individual or family/small-group level. Examples include studies investigating how people manage personal finances in particular circumstances, as well as how people engaged with money on an experiential level. At larger scales, HCI has also taken into account the social world around financial transactions to theorise around the design of potential future payment systems; and alternative forms of capital such as cryptocurrencies and the surrounding Blockchain technologies have accountability baked into the infrastructure of the systems themselves. Previous HCI work demonstrates that people interact with money and their personal finances in a number of ways. Kaye et al discuss how interaction can play out at an emotional level; as individuals may make decisions that do not appear ’rational’ from a purely financial perspective but are instead driven by other factors such as personal history or experience with debt. A second facet is a form of management of ’pots’ of money. In this context, money is not treated as a single entity but divided up along lines such as origin or intended use, and people use a variety of self-made or adaptable tools (both digital and analogue) in order to achieve this management; such as folders, notebooks, and spreadsheets. This practice of dividing money semantically is notably also shown in the work of Vines et al when studying techniques people use to manage a low income. Finally, dealing with the unknown or ’higher powers’ is an important facet of people’s relationships with money as they may lack important information held about them; such as their current Credit Scores (often used as a measure of financial health in the US), and they understand that their personal futures may contain events that they have not financially planned or accounted for. Vines et al go on to describe how the systems people implement can give them a ’confidence through awareness’ which may act as a ballast that partly allays their fears.</p>
<p>At the community Scale, Ferreira et al explored the social world surrounding money, specifically a community currency known as the Bristol Pound. Their work discusses how exchanges of money using the currency shared aspects of a conversation, as the transactors would engage in social interactions that were unbounded by the settings roles such as ’shopkeeper’ and ’customer’, prompted by the technology use required to pay with the currency. Further to this, the use of the shared currency (and the technological systems supporting it) gave the transactors an indication of shared values and interests.</p>
<p>Other instances of digital technologies supporting group use of money is the use of ‘Crowdfunding’ websites such as Kickstarter, or GoFundMe. In particular, the language and mechanisms of these sites share similarities with the process of donating to charities. These sites offer options wherein donators to a particular fund may have their donation returned if, for example, the total requested amount of donations has not been met. Beltran et al extend this concept further with their deployment of ‘Codo‘ which they describe as “Fundraising with Conditional Donations”. In this deployment, Beltran et al describe how they developed a logical grammar which allows a donor on the system to more richly prescribe (or describe) the conditions of their donation, such as matching funds from other individuals or those within a defined group. Whilst this system does not proffer much in the way of exploring how organisations can report back on their expenditure, it presents the case that conditions may be put forward and codified as a means of providing a rudimentary accountability; as an organisation may need to attract the support of more than disparate groups in order to receive their donations. This opens up the possibility that a system may be developed with an ’accountability spin’, where conditions are put upon funds by Funding bodies that request reimbursement under the event that conditions that they set out are not adequately met.</p>
<p>It is also important to note that my previous work has explicitly explored how Transparency and Accountability are, as of writing, poorly supported by digital technologies. This findings of this initial, exploratory, work highlights similarities between how individuals semantically divide money into ’pots’ and how charities’ finances are often restricted to particular use-cases due to how charity funding operates. This study also indicated that it may be appropriate to shift focus from financial transparency towards making organisation’s ’visible’. This harks back to the historical roots of Transparency as a part-Science of making the social world knowable discussed earlier. The means to achieve this would be to produce a more qualitative form of accounting and supporting the interrogation of information collected by using standardised web technologies</p>

<h1 id="sec:method">Methodology</h1>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>This chapter discusses and interrogates the methodologies, approaches, and procedures used in the performance of the research project. It begins by describing the methodological frameworks that informed the project holistically via introducing the landscape in which the research was performed; and reflects on how the research was organised on-the-ground around this landscape. In doing this I reflect on how my visions of participation going into the project required a degree of reconfiguration in order to be reconciled with the realities of becoming involved in the glorious, yet often erratic world, that is the Third Sector.</p>

</ul>
<p>This section discusses how the research was organised around the landscape it was performed in. I present a brief overview of the organisations who participated in the research, and discuss how the characteristics each of these required the research to be configured in response.</p>
<h3 id="research-landscape-or-the-volcanic-soil-of-the-third-sector">Research Landscape or ‘The Volcanic Soil of the Third Sector’</h3>
<p>As discussed in Chapter 1, the Third Sector is a sector of economic activity that is situated outside of both Government and For-Profit contexts. The organisations that make up this sector come in an inordinate amount of shapes, flavours, and structures but all share important characteristics – they do not distribute profit to shareholders, they are self-governing, and they do not coerce participation in their activities (historically, at least). They are generally seen as important actors in society; since their very existence can be argued as a symptom of a market failure for both the State and capitalist ventures to provide adequate solutions to hardships of their beneficiaries. This is often manifested as an attendance to matters such as grassroots development, and/or the provision of local services which are generally understood to produce or sustain Social Capital.</p>
<p>If we take the above as granted, then the importance of the Third Sector to society at large is already fairly remarkable. During the period of time described in the research, however, the UK has been in the throes of a Conservative-lead policy of ‘Austerity’ for some time following capitalism’s latest crisis (the 2008 crash). Government cuts have resulted in the drastic reduction or death of many State-provided or Local Government services in many contexts (Health and Social Care, Youth and Play Work, Support Services, to name a few), which has in turn resulted in Third Sector organisations such as Charities ‘picking up the slack’ and providing services to communities themselves, often on behalf of the same Local Government Organisations (Councils) that once provided them in-house. This is often achieved by combining funding received from partnership with the Councils with other funding sought from elsewhere. At the same time, large amounts of funding are <span><em>“drying up”</em></span> (as one participant put it) and charities are often struggling to survive month-to-month.</p>
<p>This bears mentioning because the gravity of this situation became apparent to me early on in my fieldwork, and all actions that I took (particularly producing design interventions) would have real impacts on the organisations I worked with. Given the current state of affairs, I put forward that any and all research performed on, with, within, or otherwise alongside Charities is akin to farming on volcanic soil. Charities are often the focal point for community activity, and act as a crucible in which the forces of change are reaching a critical temperature and therefore research performed on this soil is intensively fertile. The trade-off is that if one is researching without genuine care for the fruits of their (and their collaborators’) labours; if they are unaware of the pressures that they operate under — then they risk having a severe and real impact on an organisation’s ability to perform their work and in turn, sacrifice the lives of those caught in the fallout.</p>
<p>The bulk of my research was performed with a small charity known as ‘The Patchwork Project’ (Patchy, to the locals) in the West End of Newcastle upon Tyne; an area known largely for suffering the regular tensions related to economic deprivation and a high immigrant population. Patchy, are a Youth Charity who cater their activities to those aged between 8-25. More can be read about them in Chapter 3, however my prolonged involvement with them, especially in the early stages of research, ensured that</p>
<h2 id="sec:method:fieldwork">Interactions, Work, and Labour: Approaches to Fieldwork and Analysis</h2>
<h3 id="ethnomethodological-orientation-to-fieldwork">Ethnomethodological Orientation to Fieldwork</h3>
<p>The goal of fieldwork in this research was to provide a corpus of data that could be used to understand how those operating in the design space (workers at charitable organisations) reasoned about their work, their finances, and what role digital technologies played in this. Taking an ethnomethodolgical orientation to the fieldwork allows the investigation to focus on pragmatics of how accounting work is done in charities, how members of these settings engage with each other accountably, and thus how organisational Transparency and Accountability are, in turn, “done” <span class="citation">Crabtree, Rouncefield, and Tolmie (2012; Garfinkel 1967)</span></p>
<p>Ethnomethodology concerns itself with how members of a social setting organise and make sense of their social world; carring very little commitment to particular epistemologies or ontologies excepting those that are utilised on a mundane basis by the focus of its studies <span class="citation">Randall, Harper, and Rouncefield (2007; Garfinkel 1967)</span>. Further to this, it has been said, however, that Ethnomethodology <span><em>“carries little or no theoretical baggage”</em></span> and consists of analytical choices as to what the fieldworker attends to <span class="citation">Randall, Harper, and Rouncefield (2007)</span>. Its focus on how members of a setting construct their reality, however, gives it attitudes rooted in Phenomenology’s description of the <em>Natural Attitude</em> <span class="citation">Sharrock and Anderson (1986)</span>.</p>
<p>Ethnomethodology has a variety of flavours, and has given rise to such practices as Conversation Analysis . My fieldwork was focused on the everyday practices of a setting and as such I consider it an instance of an <em>ethnomethodological study of work</em>.</p>
<p>Following from this, ethnomethodology focuses on how the interactional work performed by a setting’s members is made ‘accountable’ to others.</p>
<p>One notable feature of Ethnomethodology is the ‘indifference’ of sociological dichotomies such as the question of objectivity vs subjectivity, and instead insists that the fieldworker develop a <em>vulgar competence</em> in a setting’s work to be able and describe it in the language of the setting’s members <span class="citation">Randall, Harper, and Rouncefield (2007; Crabtree, Rouncefield, and Tolmie 2012)</span>. In doing so, this acknowledges how members of the setting are producing and recognising their own contextual structures; and how they are making them mutually intelligible or naturally accountable to one another <span class="citation">Garfinkel (1967; Randall, Harper, and Rouncefield 2007)</span>.</p>
<p>Finally, the relationship that ethnomethodologically-informed fieldwork has to systems design contexts made it suitable for these enquiries.</p>
<h3 id="taking-a-marxist-stance">Taking a Marxist stance</h3>
<p>The performance of the first large portion of fieldwork in the study, beginning March 2016, overlapped with a series of events in my personal life that began a pronounced interest in Marxism. This is worth mentioning because the process resulted in engagment with a host of classic, modern, and academic literatures. This had a subsequent effect on my reading of fieldwork data with regards to labour relations of workers, and helped shape the design of systems that were built in response.</p>
<p>Marxism, and therefore Marxist stances, can be said to be concerned primarily with the relationships between workers, their labour, capital, and property <span class="citation">Singer (2001; Johnson 2012)</span>. The foci offered by Marxism resonated with the research goals in as much as they were set out to determine in what ways the work of charities related to financial capital, and what role technology played in this relationship. Taking a Marxist stance meant, to me, orienting myself to how the labour of workers in charities was performed; how it was valued, and how it was represented in the various types of formal and informal accounts produced at the field site when accounting for activity or spending.</p>
<p>In Marxist theory, the work and value of any organisation, charities included, is ultimately derived from the labour of its workers <span class="citation">Marx (1970)</span>. Classic political economy (e.g. <span class="citation">Smith (1785)</span>) divides labour into the categories of <em>Productive Labour</em> and <em>Unproductive Labour</em>. <em>Productive Labour</em> is labour that directly goes into increasing the wealth of an organisation, whereas <em>Unproductive Labour</em> is that which does not; but is nontheless necessary for the organisation or nation to function <span class="citation">Smith (1785)</span>. Marxism is famous for its critique of this classical and arbitrary divide of the productive and unproductive forms of labour; a critique that, in summary, attacks the notions of <em>Productive</em> and <em>Unproductive</em> as having no neutral definition; as work is not naturally productive and it takes work to make it so <span class="citation">Marx et al. (1974; Marx 1964)</span>. Instead, what is seen as <em>Productive</em> or <em>Unproductive</em> is in constant flux and based on a multitude of different factors such as the mode of production<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>, social class, and what the ‘product’ actually is <span class="citation">Marx et al. (1974)</span>. When studying charities, this makes sense — taking the classical approach, it would seem as if the only thing within a charity that could be called <em>Productive Labour</em> is the act of writing applications for grants!</p>
<p>The Marxist stance on labour assisted in analysis of the fieldwork by providing a framework within which I could reason about the findings. Whilst ethnomethodology allowed for pragmatic insight into the interactional work of the field site itself, Marxian critiques of labour grounded these in what was needed to be captured to provide insight into design work. Namely, if the distinction between <em>Productive</em> and <em>Unproductive</em> Labour was based on an arbitrary dilineation, where was that line drawn in the field site? How did participants reason about what they classed as productive, and how was this accounted for to themselves and others? With Marxism being so closely related to my personal politics, I was initially apprehensive about taking this analytical stance. This anxiety was at least partially assuaged when I reflected upon findings of my previous study around charities and transparency. This study discussed that tensions around transparency in spending orbited around a focus on bottom line spending; leaving out the effort (labour) of volunteers and underplaying importance of the labour required of administrative tasks when discussing outcomes; therefore emphasising the importance of accounting for the nature of workers’ labour in the field site and its relevance to design <span class="citation">Marshall, Kirk, and Vines (2016)</span>.</p>
<p>In establishing the relationship between field notes from Ethnomethodological studies and Marxism, it becomes necessary to elaborate on the relationship between Marxism and Ethnomethodology themselves. Chua explores Ethnomethodology from a Marxist perspective as means in which ideological reproduction may be investigated, conceiving of ideology as a symptom of social knowledge <span class="citation">Chua (1977)</span>. Ethnomethodology is described as a focus on investigating the rational nature of a setting’s activities and thus providing an analytical tool for Marxists to investigate how ideological systems operate as ‘natural’ ways of knowing and interpreting the world <span class="citation">Chua (1977)</span>. Freund and Abrams share this sentiment and examine Ethnomethodology’s treatment of information and social perception as linked to the practical interests of those producing them, therfore showing that social perception and information produced by existing (and therefore bourgeouis) institutions, is false <span class="citation">Freund and Abrams (1976)</span>. This gives Ethnomethodology and Marxism important shared characteristicvs, as both see social knowledge being bound to the contexts and methods that produced them, as well as indicating that both perspectives fuse theory and praxis <span class="citation">Freund and Abrams (1976)</span>. Chua elaborates that the specificity and characteristic indifference of Ethnomethodologically-informed studies means that results must be appropriated within the wider context of Marxist sociology, but that Marxists should otherwise encourage Ethnomethogological studies <span class="citation">Chua (1977)</span>. Conversely, investigating the relevance of Marx to Ethnomethodology, Mehan and Wood associate Ethnomethodology with a synthesis of both the hermeneutic-dialectial, and the logico-empiricist traditions; that whilst the methodology of Ethnomethodology is firmly rooted in logico-empricisim, its theory has derived from hermeneutic-dialectics, and Ethnomethodology’s alienation as a method stems from this transcendancy of its conflicting roots <span class="citation">Mehan and Wood (1975)</span>. Marxism similarly straddles these realms, simultaneously having its philosophical roots in Dialectics with the development of Dialectical-Materialism, and possessing what is widely regarded as a scientific approach to the investigation of social life and political economy <span class="citation">Thomas (2008)</span>. Also of note is the similarity between Ethnomethodology’s attendence to practical action <span class="citation">Garfinkel (1967; Crabtree, Rouncefield, and Tolmie 2012)</span> and Marx’s thesis that <span><em>“All social life is essentially practical”</em></span> <span class="citation">Marx and Engels (1963)</span>. Indeed, Mehan and Wood argue that following the conception of Ethnomethodology, Marx can be viewed as a <span><em>“crypto-ethnomethodologist”</em></span> due to this <span class="citation">Mehan and Wood (1975)</span>.</p>
<p>Beyond this, I feel that it is also important to consider that core tenants of Ethnomethodology appear to be directly related to Marxist stances on human labour. In Marxism, <em>Labour</em> is also described as <em>Life Activity</em>; encompassing not only participation in economic activity, but all acts that human beings undertake – from acts of recreation and love, to tilling fields and designing software <span class="citation">Marx (1844; Mitchell 2013)</span>. It is therefore possible to conceive of the <em>Interactional Work</em> attested to by Ethnomethodology <span class="citation">Garfinkel (2005; Crabtree, Rouncefield, and Tolmie 2012)</span> as an expression of <em>Labour</em> when viewed through a Marxist lense; and reflexively adds the act of organising one’s social reality to the definition of <em>Labour</em> as conceived of in this thesis.</p>

<h1 id="sec:emp01">Accountability Work: Examining the Values, Technologies and Work Practices that Facilitate Transparency in Charities</h1>
<p><strong>Note to readers: This is basically a ripped version of a paper that was rejected from the ACM CHI conference. As such it currently refers to itself as a paper and not a chapter. It also contains a background section and methods section, which need to change. It just needs to be in here so that I begin to work on it</strong></p>
<p>This paper discusses the role of data technologies in Charitable Organisations (charities) as they seek to become transparent and accountable in their work and their financial practices. Charities play an important role in society, oftentending to issues of importance to populations and communities where both the private and state sectors have lacked engagement (or resources) <span class="citation">Salamon (1994)</span>. Due to the nature of much of their funding, through grants and public donations, charities are required to demonstrate to stakeholders both a commitment to their aims and a competency in their financial practices <span class="citation">MacMillan et al. (2005; Oliver 2004)</span>. Data technologies play an increasingly important role in mediating transparency for organisations by supporting the online reporting and publishing of financial data <span class="citation">Meijer (2009)</span>, while the production of open data is widely claimed to be synonymous with transparency in dialogues around government and business <span class="citation">Coleman (2013; Goldstein 2013; Gordon and Baldwin-Philippi 2013b)</span>. Recent work within HCI has examined the use of open data by charities for constructing narratives <span class="citation">Erete et al. (2016)</span>, the use of data for metrics for reporting and understanding <span class="citation">Elsden, Mellor, et al. (2016)</span>, and has provided insight into how digital systems can provide more comprehensive forms of transparency in these organisations <span class="citation">Marshall, Kirk, and Vines (2016)</span>. However, thus far there is little understanding of how technologies like these, and more commonplace data technologies, and data work, integrate into the daily, lived, work of charities.</p>
<p>Our research sets out to address this deficit and better understand how transparency and accountability manifest in the daily activities of charities. We conducted a qualitative study of work practice in a charity that conducts youth work for economically deprived and migrant communities in the North of England. Over a period of 7 months the first author spent an average of 2 days a week conducting ethnographic fieldwork at the charity’s main community hub and office, and participated in both delivery of community-facing activities and administrative work. The fieldwork was oriented towards developing a praxeological account of how financial work is performed within the organisation <span class="citation">Crabtree, Rouncefield, and Tolmie (2012)</span>. The findings from our fieldwork provide insight into the tools and processes used by members of such a setting to organise and make sense of their activities and finances and, more crucially, the work that is required to make this <em>transparent</em> and <em>accountable</em> to others. We also discuss the tensions that exist between the everyday execution of charitable work and the legal or contractual obligations to account for it in particular ways. In doing so we highlight how organisations can navigate these issues in order to make themselves accountable not only ‘on paper’ but to those who rely on the charity’s projects and services.</p>
<p>This work contributes to the field of HCI in two ways. First, we produce an account of a charity’s work practices as they relate to data technologies, financial transparency, and accountability. In doing this we extend HCI’s discussion of technologies and organisational accountability <span class="citation">Marshall, Kirk, and Vines (2016)</span> by illuminating how this relates to the lived practice of those whose work these technologies will impact. Secondly, in discussing the tensions that exist in these settings, we extend current work in HCI around sharing data for sensemaking, human-data interaction and organisational transparency, by presenting a set of design recommendations for future systems. In doing so, we discuss how HCI can affect real change in charities worldwide by facilitating engagement with their work’s value, and communicating this to others.</p>
<h2 id="background-and-related-work">Background and Related Work</h2>
<p>It is generally understood that charities play an important role in society. They perform work in areas and matters generally left unattended by state or private sectors. This includes driving grass-roots development and human services <span class="citation">Salamon (1994)</span>, the creation and sustenance of social capital within communities and for particularly marginalised populations. <em>Social Capital</em> <span class="citation">Field (2003; Mendel and Brudney 2014)</span>. It can be said that a charity’s very existence indicates a substantial need for its model of service delivery, due to the failure of the market to regulate for-profit entities which may engage in potentially harmful or exploitative practices<span class="citation">Hansmann (1980)</span>.</p>
<p>The importance of their role and their funding mechanisms makes accountability a cornerstone in the public’s relationship with Charities. This is for, at least, two reasons. First, due to the important role that charities play in society, making an organisation accountable for actions it takes ensures that it is true to its mission and do not abuse the trust of the public and other stakeholders who might support its cause <span class="citation">Frumkin (2006; Jacobson 2005)</span>. Second, due to the fact that charities are often funded with grants from private or public funds, it is argued that they should be held accountable and act transparently in regards to their financial practices. This is to ensure that they are seen to be using funds both appropriately and efficaciously. Furthermore, due to the nature of charitable funding, this means having multiple and diverse stakeholders to which they must be accountable <span class="citation">Krashinsky (1997; MacMillan et al. 2005)</span>.</p>
<p>There are multiple ways in which an organisation can be said to be accountable. This can include: the extent to which its stakeholders can direct its activity <span class="citation">Koppell (2005)</span>; how it can be called upon to justify its actions <span class="citation">Fox (2007)</span>; and how it can be made to adhere to responsibilities through legal frameworks <span class="citation">Koppell (2005)</span>. These theories of accountability have impact on the way that charities conduct their everyday operations regarding work and spending. Accountability shares a complicated relationship with financial transparency; the latter often being cited as means to provide the former <span class="citation">Hood (2010)</span>. Koppell describes transparency as the foundational element for accountability upon which all of the other forms are built <span class="citation">Koppell (2005)</span>. Fox conceptualises an intersection between the two called ‘answerability’ <span class="citation">Fox (2007)</span>. For organisations there are many ways to be transparent such as passiveley revealing information or actively engaging stakeholders <span class="citation">Oliver (2004; Schauer 2011)</span>, or choosing to focus on outcomes or spend <span class="citation">Heald (2006)</span>. The position of this paper is that all forms of transparency share a concern over the dissemination and consumption of information. The purpose of being transparent, therefore, is ultimately to facilitate interactions between an organisation, its work, and stakeholders (such as funders or the wider public). These interactions are what mediate accountability, and these interactions are increasingly facilitated digitally <span class="citation">Meijer (2009; Oliver 2004)</span>.</p>
<p>The ideals and beleifs surrounding use of data and personal informatics has seen the field of HCI explore the politics and design of systems that facilitate interactions with data. At an organisational level, studies have demonstrated how charities have used open data to form narratives around local conditions <span class="citation">Erete et al. (2016)</span>, while others have highlighted how visualisations around organisational metrics (including funding) support the use of data for reporting, understanding, and providing insight in highly politicised environments <span class="citation">Elsden, Mellor, et al. (2016)</span>. In the personal sphere, concepts of data lockers allow external processors to interact with one’s data while maintaining personal control <span class="citation">McAuley, Mortier, and Goulding (2011)</span> and data itself is likened to a boundary object forming part of the infrastructure of everyday life <span class="citation">Crabtree and Mortier (2015)</span>.</p>
<p>Modern transparency efforts often legally stipulate that charities and other NPOs submit documentation for auditing and subsequent public consumption. Examples include the US’ Internal Revenue Service (IRS) <span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="internal_revenue_service_annual_2016"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span> and the UK’s Charity Commission <span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="hm_government_charity_????"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span>. The focus of these systems is typically on <em>input</em> (i.e. the money a charity spends). This is, in part, due to its ease of measurement; however such input transparencies <span class="citation">Heald (2006)</span> have been shown to be ineffective when determining how appropriate a spend is. Previous work in HCI has critiqued such systems for lacking detail and context about the work of organisations, and failing to represent non-monetary elements such as the efforts of those who volunteer for a charity’s projects and cause. The recommendations from this prior work are for new digital systems and processes that provide a more comprehensive and value-driven alternative to simple financial accounting <span class="citation">Marshall, Kirk, and Vines (2016)</span>. Additionally, imposed or expected transparency measures are often seen to be in conflict with effective practice with regards to organisational independence, confidentiality, and privacy <span class="citation">Cukierman (2009; Schauer 2014)</span>. In this way, the concerns of charities around transparency touch upon personal concerns around privacy that are addressed by McAuley et al.’s Dataware Manifesto <span class="citation">McAuley, Mortier, and Goulding (2011)</span> as charities wish to communicate an accurate view of their work and its value but may have concerns presenting data about activity or spend that can be misinterpreted by others who may not understand its context. Furthermore, on a lived and pragmatic level, ‘being transparent’ can create additional work for organisations due to the effort involved in performing audits, monitoring and reporting that they are legally or conractually obliged to. It also means charities have to expend further effort to communicate their practice and value (as opposed to values) in order to maintain a relationship with their stakeholders <span class="citation">MacMillan et al. (2005)</span>.</p>
<p>The work reported in this paper builds upon previous studies in HCI around the design of systems to facilitate transparency and accountability in charities <span class="citation">Marshall, Kirk, and Vines (2016)</span>, and work that discusses the use of data for interaction by and between individuals and organisations <span class="citation">Crabtree and Mortier (2015; Elsden, Mellor, et al. 2016)</span>. Where previous work investigates the design for interfaces to interact with data, or the ownership and processing of the same, it typically fails to account for the work needed in organisations to compile this data in the first place. As such, our research set out to ask: how is work performed and money spent; how is this accounted for in a charity?; and what are the processes that make this available to others? In asking and examining these questions through ethographic fieldwork, this research seeks to provide insights around the ways in which digital systems can be designed to facilitate the work of ‘being transparent’ as part of everyday practice in charities.</p>
<h2 id="study-design">Study Design</h2>
<p>Our fieldwork was conducted over a period of seven months with a small charity in the UK based in the city of [anonymous for peer review]; Pallet (a pseudonym for the purposes of reporting the research). The organisation has three full-time and four part-time staff (Table [tab:participants]), and an average financial turnover of approximately 130k. Pallet are a youth organisation that perform work with young people aged between 8 and 25 years in a catchment area typically seen as experiencing tensions related to economic deprivation and a high immigrant population. The participating organisation was approached due to a recommendation of a collaborator who represents the third-sector across the entire region; Pallet were presented as an organisation who have a significant presence in their community, whose work is value-driven, and are exemplar of small charities with flexible funding. They were also presented as being enthusiastic about becoming involved in research of this subject and scope.</p>
<p>Fieldwork and data collection were primarily ethnographic in nature <span class="citation">Crabtree, Rouncefield, and Tolmie (2012)</span>, formed of participatory-observation activities at Pallet. This involved shadowing, assisting with accounts preparation, and interviewing members of staff, volunteers, and service users in-situ. Near the conclusion of fieldwork three workshops were conducted that acted as an opportunity for members of the organisation to engage in checking and elaborating on the emerging insights of our fieldwork, as well as stimulating further reflection on their practices and their use of data and technologies.</p>

<h3 id="ethnography">Ethnography</h3>
<p>Our ethnographic work began in early 2016. Initially, the fieldwork came in the form of weekly visits by the lead author to Pallet in order to participate in their daily administrative and planning sessions. At this time, visits were targeted to coincide with the shifts of the part-time administrator so that the lead author could engage with their work as well as that of other staff members.</p>
<p>After three such visits, fieldwork expanded to include participating in the organisation’s work as a volunteer youth worker on a weekly basis. This further facilitated the lead author’s integration into the charity, and provided opportunities to participate in and observe Pallet performing their work in the community in order to develop a deeper understanding of their practices. Through this participant-observation, the lead author was able to develop a vulgar competence <span class="citation">Crabtree, Rouncefield, and Tolmie (2012)</span> of organisational processes from which to learn from and reflect upon. At this point, vists became more frequent and occurred several times a week with days being spent partly participating in administration and planning, and partly in the performance of a volunteer role in community sessions and projects.</p>
<p>During this time at the organisaiton the author was given a range of duties to perform such as: everyday purchasing of equipment for activities; attending meetings of stakeholders; being involved in strategy meetings with partners; the creation of monitoring materials such as questionnaires; and reconciling financial accounts. The author was also given copies of the yearly accounts spreadsheets to inspect at leisure, with instruction to ask any questions as required. Informal interviews often occured in-situ, either when the researcher desired clarification of an activity as it occured in-the-moment, or when reflection on fieldnotes lead to a question which could only be answered by the settings members. These informal interviews were not audio-recorded, although integrated into the data corpus through fieldnotes and fieldwork diaries.</p>
<p>The seven-month ethnography comprised 49 unique visits and engagement in 27 volunteering activities. Some 70 pages of fieldnotes and fieldwork diaries were generated, and elaborated on with discussions with settings members, as activities occured.</p>
<h3 id="workshops">Workshops</h3>
<p>In the final stages of our fieldwork, a series of three workshops were conducted with workers at Pallet. During the first workshop, four staff members and one volunteer staff participated. Only three of the staff were available for the second workshop. However all four participated in the final workshop, alongside one trustee of the organisation.</p>
<p>The purpose of these workshops was to provide a setting in which the workers could reflect further on their practices as an organisation and discuss the role that technologies and data play, and might play in the future, in the daily operations of the charity. The workshops were also an opportunity for members to check the preliminary insights from our fieldwork, and to offer further elaboration on specific points. In total, three workshops were run at three-to-four week intervals. The workshops each lasted an average of 105 minutes, with the first being slightly longer than the subsequent two due to the personal schedules of participants. All workshops were audio-recorded (with permission) and written transcripts were produced.</p>
<p>The first workshop was designed to elicit reflection on how the organisation communicated its spending and activities internally as well as with stakeholders. Participants engaged in a collaborative process using common office materials (e.g. corkboards, post-its) to build up a rich picture <span class="citation">Monk and Howard (1998)</span> of Pallet and its ecosystem. First participants noted individual elements of their processes including: staff; stakeholders; assets and resources; government bodies; funders; and beneficiaries. Participants notably chose to represent these elements on a loose spectrum from <span><em>“inside [Pallet]”</em></span> to <span><em>“outside [Pallet]”</em></span>. Once these elements had been added, the researcher prompted discussion of information flows around Pallet between different elements, using examples derived from fieldwork. These were captured on the rich picture using coloured string and map pins to represent different flows and activities. After some time doing this, the researcher moved the discussion to the flows of financial capital. This portion of the workshop followed a similar process, using examples derived from fieldwork to prompt reflection on these flows, again which participants mapped onto the rich picture using coloured string and pins. Finally, the session concluded with a targeted reflection on tension points the participants felt were identified in the workshop.</p>
<p>The second workshop had the purpose of exploring in further depth the relationship between the participants and data about the organisation’s finances and work practice. In this workshop, participants were first given nine scenarios written by the lead author, which imagined a variety of potential interactions with data about the organisation’s activities. The participants chose to read each scenario aloud in turn, and discuss each one before moving to the next. After each scenario was discussed (approx 60 minutes in total), the participants were asked to design their own vision for supporting accountability and transparency in the organisation. Participants were told that their designs did not need to be technologically feasible, and could resemble ‘magic buttons’ to do what they wanted. Participants, again, opted for a group dynamic where they spent a brief time sketching or writing, and then discussing the ideas in depth between each other and the researcher.</p>
<p>The third workshop was designed to allow participants to build further on the concepts that they’d discussed in the previous workshops. Based on a design brief given by the facilitator, participants used commonplace materials to construct ‘magic machines’ that an imagined future version of Pallet would use to perform tasks related to transparency and accountability. After approximately 45 minutes of building individual machines, workers took turns to explain them through demonstrating their use around the setting (the charity’s main office). Here they would physically take the researcher and other participants to areas in which the machine was imagined to operate as they elaborated on its functions and their interactions with it.</p>
<h2 id="findings">Findings</h2>
<p>Our findings are compiled from field notes and diaries collected during the lead researcher’s immersion at the organisation, as well as transcripts from the audio recordings made during workshop events. These were used to develop praxeological accounts of work <span class="citation">Crabtree, Rouncefield, and Tolmie (2012)</span> around the organisaiton’s activities related to producing accounts of their work, both financial and otherwise.</p>
<p>The findings presented here are grouped based on the activities they relate to: Accounts of Finances; Accounts of Outcomes; and Accounts of Unproductive Labour. <em>Unproductive Labour</em> here refers to the effort required by the workers of the charity to make their work productive <span class="citation">Marx (1970)</span>, and we concern ourselves not only with how this is performed but how this is accounted for and communicated to others.</p>
<h3 id="accounting-for-spending">Accounting for Spending</h3>
<p>Spending from funded projects occurs on an everyday basis for things that are required to achieve the charity’s immediate outcomes and goals, as well as having core costs such as staff salaries and bills which are paid through other processes. In this section we describe how the charity account for everyday spending, staff and core costs, as well as what is involved in producing ‘the accounts’ required by legal processes.</p>
<h4 id="everyday-spending">Everyday Spending</h4>
<p>One of the first things we observed during fieldwork is that everyday spending is accounted for internally by instituting a system of funelling all spend through two senior members of staff. Chelsea, the charity’s part-time administrator, described this in the fieldwork:</p>
<p><strong>Chelsea</strong> <span><em>“The staff get paid back through expenses, and only Mike and Andi are allowed to make expenses claims which they’ll make generally when they notice their bank accounts are getting low”</em></span>.</p>
<p>Chelsea here indicates that Mike and Andi use their personal bank accounts to make purchases for the organisation in order to ensure that any expenses made can be deemed appropriate. That they only claim for expenses when they <span><em>“notice their bank accounts are geting low”</em></span> also indicates that there is a practice of storing records of these transactions in order to compile them and reimburse the spender. We also observed that although all spending must be funelled through either Andi or Mike, often other staff members made purchases as part of their everyday work. This occurs in one of two ways, both of which we describe in a vignette below, which describes events occurring over two days of fieldwork:</p>
<p><em>I had been called to help with the planning and execution of the ‘Community Activity Day’ at the Play Centre. The day itself was taking place on the first of June, but I was participating in the planning on the day before. After I had arrived, Sonia and I were tasked with producing a grocery list for an outdoor BBQ that was occuring as part of the day. After a quick discussion regarding items for the menu, we needed to come up with quantities. I asked Sonia what the expected turn out was and she said “Probably at least 70”. We agreed to plan for around 80 attendees and proceeded to leave the centre towards the supermarket, where we were approached on the side of the road by Mike in the minibus. He asks us if we’re “off to buy food”, and when Sonia replies that we are he says “Here, take this” and hands his debit card over, before asking Sonia “Do you know the PIN?”. She nods affirmatively and Mike chuckles before saying to me “Aye. Half of [district area] know that PIN now” and driving off. When we are in the supermarket, Sonia and I traverse it looking for the items we need — Sonia makes a point to purchase the cheapest possible store-brand products, searching for them on the shelves and looking frustrated when none appear available. When I ask if it’s possible to get one of the others she tells me “We can’t be seen to be buying brands really”. After we have everything in the basket, we purchase it using Mike’s card. Back at the project hub, Mike returns around an hour later during lunch and retrieves his card and the receipt of purchase from Sonia, checking over it briefly before putting it in his wallet.</em></p>
<p><em>On the day of the ‘Community Activity Day’ I was walking towards the Play Centre in order to volunteer my labour, when Mike pulled up in the minibus heading in the opposite direction (at speed). He stops only to hand me 20 and tells me “We need [toilet roll] for the Play Centre. Go get some from [convenience store] across the road, the big cheap pack at the back of the shop” before driving off. I turn around, find the store and make the purchase, and then make my way to the Play Centre. Inside, the Play Centre is already full of activity with adults and children moving around. I find Andi and hand her the money, which she takes and asks for a receipt. I find the receipt in my pocket and hand it to her and she stores it together with Mike’s change in her back pocket before assigning me my role for the day.</em></p>
<p>This vignette first illustrates the ways in which spending is funeled through the senior staff whilst allowing the organisation to distribute the labour of purchasing by devolving responsibility for the physical purchase. Sonia is handed Mike’s debit card so that it is <em>his money</em> that is spent, and this acts as a buffer between the member of staff and the organisation’s finances. This buffer is also present when Mike hands cash to the researcher so that they can participate in spending. Further to this, that Mike checks the receipt, and Sonia’s awareness of not wishing to be <span><em>“seen to be buying brands”</em></span> shows a checking process that means that Sonia may have to justify purchases to Mike if called upon. This also shows that the staff involved in purchasing are aware of the charity’s overall budget and tailor their purchases to ensure it’s appropriate; also seen when Mike explicitly provides the lead author with instructions to purchase <span><em>“the big cheap pack”</em></span> of toilet roll.</p>
<h4 id="staff-salaries">Staff Salaries</h4>
<p>Table [tab:participants] lists the staff at Pallet. There are three full-time staff: Mike, the manager; Andi, the senior youth worker; and Dean, a youth worker. The three part-time staff are: Lynne, the administrator (replacing Chelsea who had the role at the start of fieldwork); Ladislav, a youth worker; and Sonia, a youth worker. When ethnography started, the administrator role was performed by Chelsea.</p>
<p>During discussion with Chelsea at the start of fieldwork, we discussed with her how staff are salaried at the organisation:</p>
<p><strong>Chelsea:</strong> <span><em>“Dean and Andi get paid full time, I get paid part-time for about 16 hours a week. Mike works full-time but he’s only paid part-time.”</em></span></p>
<p>Chelsea lists several of the staff and their pay-schemes, but noticeably says here that Mike is working full time but only paid for part of his work, indicating that his salary is variable even though his role is central to the organisation. During a subsequent fieldwork session, Mike elaborated on this when asked:</p>
<p><span><em>“It’s what’s best for [Pallet]. We have to keep things going. I don’t care how much I get paid, and it’s money that I have to end up looking for. I put the salaries down for the last few years, and it took a while to put Dean up to 20,000 when he started because the money just wasn’t there. What with the Lottery Fund coming in now we can start thinking about putting the salaries back to normal.”</em></span></p>
<p>Mike’s discussion of the staff accepting lower pay provides insight into the values of the organisation. The staff are dedicated to the organisation’s work, and are aware of their impact on its finances; accepting lower pay in order to <span><em>“keep things going”</em></span>. Where Mike discusses having to look for the money to pay staff, he also touches upon how an increase in pay creates an increase in labour as he is required to expend effort sourcing funds to make up the difference. Further into fieldwork, Mike provides additional insight into this during discussion about staff salaries and standard pay increases amid the adjusted salaries:</p>
<p><strong>Mike:</strong> <em>“So we’re putting the salaries up starting next month which is a big relief for everyone. I’ll be on 30k, but not really because that means more tax so you have to judge it carefully. Because of the tax brackets, past a certain point it makes no sense to give me a pay increase because of how much it’ll cost. What is an extra hundred to me per week will be several thousand a year to the charity which I then have to find and justify finding. This way everyone still sees their pay increase, including me, but I’m not too worried about finding the extra cash. It’s still the least you’ll ever see another project manager get paid round here though. Some of the larger organisations have six or seven heads on about 100k so that’s like nearly a million you need before you even get anything done.”</em></p>
<p>This again shows Mike’s awareness of the staff salaries having an impact on the organisation; he is willing to keep his salary lower than that of comparable positions in the area (<span><em>“round here”</em></span>) and demonstrates that he would need to justify to others a pay increase that required searching for a disproportionate amount of further funding. Mike also mentions how the staff will be relieved that the salaries are being brought in line with standard pay rises; illustrating that the salary cuts have tangible effects on staff and further defining their position as a value-driven cohort. When Mike discusses the salaries of larger organisations he also reveals his views on what money and people are supposed to do in an organisation; they are supposed to be put towards the work of the organisation and paying head staff large salaries creates extra work and financial pressure <span><em>“before you even get anything done”</em></span>.</p>
<h4 id="compiling-accounts">Compiling Accounts</h4>
<p>All of the organisation’s income and spending must be accounted for formally through the compilation of ‘the accounts’; records of financial transactions that must be reconciled, audited and presented to governing bodies. This compilation of accounts was one of the activities we involved ourselves in during fieldwork, generally performed alongside the administrator (Chelsea, and later Lynne). When being initially instructed in the task by Mike, we were given insight into the role of financial accounts in the organisation and what is involved in the task:</p>
<p><strong>Mike:</strong> <span><em>“We have this budgeting tool. It’s an Excel spreadsheet really, do you know Excel? Anyway this Australian lad who used to work for us set it up, we can add funders and add spending and stuff and we can use it to see how much we have left in each budget. At the end of each financial year this gets sent to the accountant so they can sign it off for us.”</em></span></p>
<p>This example encapsulates how the organisation views using the spreadsheet when doing budgeting; Mike refers to it explicitly as a tool, with which he can present an account of the organisation’s budget to himself, and can be used to generate another account to others (one which is legally stipulated). We did, however, witness that there are often tensions arising from Pallet’s use of their spreadsheet. We describe this in a vignette below:</p>
<p><em>It was the start of the day and we were having a scrum, after everyone says their job for the day Mike asks to speak to me about doing something with the Patchwork accounts. “I’m not happy with the accountants at the moment, they’re being problematic”. I ask why and he responds that “They just want us to use Sage [business accounting software], do you know Sage?” I respond that I don’t, and Mike continues “The accountants don’t like that we don’t use Sage, and I think that’s because they can just import it and have it do their job for them.”</em></p>
<p>Here Mike shows us that there is an explicit point of contention between Pallet and their accountants when the accounts are audited. Pallet have developed an in-house tool that allows them to present an account of spend to themselves and others. Yet because the file cannot be read by the accountant’s software then this makes it incomprehensible to them. Mike then elaborates and tells us how the accountants are trying to influence Pallet’s practice to suit their own, and postulates that it is to reduce the labour of the accountant. That Mike starts by telling us that he’s <span><em>“not happy with the accountants”</em></span> shows that he feels that the organisation have fulfilled their obligation to produce an account of their spending. Further insight to this was provided during later fieldwork, when the researcher attended a trustee’s meeting, and it came to discuss the accounts:</p>
<p><strong>Mike:</strong> <span><em>“We’re thinking of scrapping [accountants]. They’ve upped the price to 1300, which nobody around the doors is happy with by the way, and they’re trying to force us to use Sage so we do their job for them. We’ve spoken to a woman we found on [a listing] who says she’ll do it for 20 an hour and she’s happy to do them in whatever format we want. She’s been in and looked already and she’s told us that we’ve already done the job, and all she’ll need to do is double-check a few things and sign it off. We have to make sure she’s got the right, y’know, qualifications, to do that but aye it looks much better.”</em></span></p>
<p>This extract shows us that Pallet are willing to seek other accountants to perform the task who are more suited as partners as they might cost the charity less money for their services but more importantly are flexible and accepting of Pallet’s accounts regardless of format. Additionally, when Mike discusses both the price increase in reference to other organisations (<span><em>“nobody around the doors is happy with by the way”</em></span>) and checking the new accountant’s qualifications, he also demonstrates how they view their relationship; the accountant must become accountable to them and the other charities that the accountant works with). This holds true for the current accountant in terms of their service cost, and the potential new accountant having the correct qualifications for the job.</p>
<h3 id="accounting-for-outcomes">Accounting for Outcomes</h3>
<p>As well as having to account for their financial spending, Pallet also produce records of their outcomes which they demonstrate to others. We saw many examples of this during fieldwork, and present an account of one here:</p>
<p><em>During a community play session in the park, I saw that Andi was often taking photographs using her phone. Whenever she wasn’t actively engaged with young people, she would navigate to the others in the group and attempt to take a photograph of them; often to a mixed response from the young people themselves. Several of the group were very willing to be photographed, usually the young Slovak boys who took up exaggerated masculine poses such as scowling or muscle flexion. Others were more reserved, and stipulated that they only be photographed alongside the others, so that they were not the sole subject of the picture. Whenever possible, Andi would call to another youth worker such as Dean or Ladislav and ask them to get into the photograph as well. I am photographed with young people several times. The next morning, when I wake up, I have been tagged in photographs by Pallet’s Facebook account and see that most of the workers have also been tagged as well as the majority of young people in the photographs.</em></p>
<p>Andi’s behaviour shows her producing a qualitative record of the event and activity that occured. She can be seen collecting photographic evidence of their attendance in-situ, as well as using the setting to elaborate on the context of their work. The practice of uploading these to a social media profile produces an account of their activity for others to see, and the tagging of people in the photographs on the platform encourages those tagged to look at them and potentially allows others (such as parents) to glimpse the activity as well. As well as on social media, Pallet print out a selection of photographs in a poster format, which are displayed around their main community hub. The workers reflected on this practice in the first workshop:</p>
<p><strong>Andi:</strong> <span><em>“... part of it’s capturing that moment in time because it’s gonna be gone. Y’know, and it would be very easy for them to forget [...] So you’re capturing it for them, you’re capturing it for their parents to see what they’ve achieved, or for the Duke of Edinburgh so they can prove whatever it is they’ve done. You’re putting on the wall as a celebration, you’re putting it in the annual report for funders to see and also for young’uns to see [...] Like loads of kids will be like ‘will this be going on the wall?’.”</em></span></p>
<p><strong>Mike:</strong> <span><em>“I mean we dunno we just take lots of pictures because it becomes a resource for us as well. So the ones on the wall are of the D of Es because they’re positive images. Sitting down two people and talking one to one and that — it’s not very entertaining.”</em></span></p>
<p>We see here how the organisation use a resource bank of records built up by photographs for different types of accounts, to different people. Andi relates how the photographs she takes can explicitly be used as evidence for the young people’s involvement in the <em>Duke of Edinburgh</em> award, whereas Mike conceptualises them as <span><em>“positive images”</em></span> and a resource for the organisation’s future needs. Andi also explicates how the photographs are shown to parents in order to provide an account of their child’s activity (achievement) with Pallet. As well as this, we see how the photographs are repurposed to provide an account of value in the annual report, and to provide a personal record for the young people when it’s placed on the wall in <span><em>“celebration”</em></span>. The ability for these records to form a resource from which different accounts can be derived also sits in contrast to other forms of work that Pallet perform that, as Mike indicates here, are more difficult to account for (<span><em>“Sitting down two people and talking one to one and that — it’s not very entertaining”</em></span>). We observed this first-hand during fieldwork when Mike expressed frustration at the records that Pallet are required to keep of their meetings with service-users, and how it is difficult to present these to others:</p>
<p><em>I followed Mike through to the back office, and up to a large metal filing cabinet that was unlabelled. He opened it and took out a folder to show me an example, flicking through saying “Here. This is a monitoring form we have to fill out every time we have a chat with someone. You say who it was, what you chatted about and what the outcomes were. Standard ticky-box stuff. We’re meant to keep this, and we do by the way, but nobody ever asks to see it. I’ve got files here from ten year ago which haven’t seen the light of day. And people complain at us that we’re not doing our job and ticking boxes and we are, but nobody ever comes in. Nobody ever asks.”</em></p>
<p>Mike’s frustration indicates that although he is fulfilling legal and stipulated obligations designed to make them accountable for their work, they are not given an opportunity to actually do so. When Mike describes above that photographs of these chats would be <span><em>“not very entertaining”</em></span> we also see that whilst Pallet could theoretically generate records of these to show to others, the effort required to do so would not result in a substantial gain for the charity when trying to demonstrate their value.</p>
<h4 id="accountability-inside-and-outside-of-work">Accountability inside and outside of work</h4>
<p>We found that the workers at Pallet saw themselves as being accountable both in their roles as youth workers, but also as members of the community. This is characterised by Dean’s conception of accountability during discussion in the second workshop:</p>
<p><strong>Dean:</strong> <span><em>“Then there’s the visibility in and out of work. It’s not a one-way thing, I’m not Dean the youth worker during the day and I’m not Darts-Dean at night I’m both and I’ve got to be very aware that young people and the families that I work with, [...], I live in the same area as them and they are watching me constantly. In [Pallet] and out. I’ve got to be visible. It’s... an awareness of your role within the community. And I think another one for me, being accountable is remaining humble and just thinking that I’m very much where I’ve come from and I’m very like the young people I work with and they know my family.”</em></span></p>
<p>With this, Dean shows us how he sees his role in the community by living and working in the same area. Dean provides a view that accountability for his actions as a youth worker is lived in each moment. He is constantly watched by those around him, even when outside of work during his recreation activities and can therefore be seen as a whole, rather than only through a lens of his output at Pallet.</p>
<h3 id="accounting-for-unproductive-labour">Accounting for Unproductive Labour</h3>
<p>Unproductive labour is the labour required to perform the work to achieve the outcomes for the charity. In other words it is the work needed to make work productive <span class="citation">Marx (1970)</span>. In this context it refers to the additional effort expended by workers at the charity in addition to what the task demands in-the-moment. An example would be the planning required to execute a community session ahead of the labour required by session as it occurrs. We found that accounting for unproductive labour in the organisation occurs only as the labour itself occurs, during meetings, or discussions about activities and planning — and that it is rare for those outside of the organisation and immediate community to be made aware of this labour. This is often complicated by the organisation’s open-door policy, which requires that they respond directly to community members coming through the door for their services or informal chats. This particularly came to the fore in one discussion during fieldwork:</p>
<p><em>The workers were sitting down at the central table, discussing another youth project that operated elsewhere in the city. Pallet have recently acquired a Play Centre and are in the process of finding ways to use it most effectively, and so have been visiting other charities to learn from them. It’s mentioned that the other project in question produce elaborate and planned evenings of activities for all attendees at their centre whereas Pallet wouldn’t consider that. Dean sits up straight and exclaims “They’ve got the time they don’t start until half four! As soon as that shutter goes up we have work to do!” As he says this he gestures with his pen at the large window towards the front of the room, where Pallet’s hub faces the street. The rest of the group at the meeting nod silently in agreement</em></p>
<p>Dean is primarily discussing how Pallet’s work cannot be judged against that of another organisation with different working patterns. He also makes reference to the open door policy and its effect on their working day regarding planning. He also makes clear that these informal meetings are conceived of as ‘work’; there is effort expended when conversing that prevents them from performing other tasks. These conversations must be engaged in because they also form an important part of how Pallet organise their work. This was discussed during the first workshop:</p>
<p><strong>Mike:</strong> <span><em>“Aye it’s the Youth Worker, the Young People as well as it starts and it’s an outcome from the process of that conversation really. But it can be other things”</em></span></p>
<p><strong>Andi:</strong> <span><em>“So aye, [anon] is a good example. [...] I know he was doing football, I knew he was doing work experience so he’d have the time and you just think well it would be really good for him to do it for his future. Y’know, so having a conversation with him to say look are you interested in this [...].”</em></span></p>
<p>This shows how the process of engaging in conversations that arise from the open door policies can translate to outcomes, in this case a beneficiary getting a work experience placement based around a hobby. This qualifies Dean’s earlier utterance that the organisation has <span><em>“work to do”</em></span> as soon as they start: these conversations are labour that must occur for Pallet to achieve its goals effectively, but it’s difficult to provide an account of this work to others. During fieldwork, Mike related another anecdote that illustrates how outsiders are often surprised at the <em>labour</em> required to perform everyday tasks and achieve outcomes:</p>
<p><span><em>“It’s like when this guy from [a funder] came in to check. Most funders don’t and they don’t understand us. He came in and he loved it. He said that he was amazed we could keep the place running, we had so much going on around here that we deal with on a daily basis.”</em></span></p>
<p>From this we also see that Mike understands the difficulty of accounting for this labour to others — most funders do not visit and thus do not understand how the project functions. The funder is also amazed at the everyday work that occurs and was surprised at the effort being expended; which shows that this labour is not represented to them through other means and becomes accounted for only when there are others there to produce their own account.</p>
<h4 id="inferring-unproductive-labour">Inferring Unproductive Labour</h4>
<p>We mentioned that unproductive labour is generally only accounted for by those performing it as it occurred. However we saw during fieldwork that unproductive labour can often be inferred by other records that are either kept by workers or produced as a by-product of their activity:</p>
<p><em>I was participating in a planning session for the evening’s activities which was initiated when Dean and Andi each took out large workbooks and opened them. Andi asks “Where’s Mike?”, to which Dean responds that he is “down the allotment”. Andi looks puzzled at this and Dean elaborates, “He’s seeing how Liam’s getting on” and turns the notebook to show Andi. On it there is a task list which shows ‘allotment’. Andi looks at this, and nods.</em></p>
<p>This illustrates how records kept by workers can be used to infer the activity and thus the work of others in the organisation. The list offers proof of Mike’s whereabouts that Andi accepts as canonical, yet only the word ‘allotment’ is written. This tells us that, generally, there is labour that is performed at the allotment and that Mike can be found performing it. In addition to this we see that, in addition to being necessary for financial accounting, receipts can also be used to infer the labour of others:</p>
<p><em>Mike was having lunch and moving items from the tabletop out of his way, so that he could place his laptop there and write a report. When moving a pile of paper he turns to inspect it and finds a receipt, saying aloud “What’s this? Ohh. It’s the pancake stuff for tonight; Sonia’s been shopping.”</em></p>
<p>From the receipt Mike can recognise that the items are a list of ingredients to make pancakes, an activity commonly run by the charity. He also infers that there has been an expense of labour in acquiring these materials when he says <span><em>“Sonia’s been shopping”</em></span>, and can attribute this to Sonia by other mechanisms that he is privy to.</p>
<h4 id="hidden-unproductive-labour">Hidden Unproductive Labour</h4>
<p>As discussed, unproductive labour is necessary for the subsequent performance of activities that translate to outcomes. Whilst most of this labour can be inferred by the activity, or made visible to others through things such as task-lists, some of it cannot as it takes a form that doesn’t lend itself to recording. We illustrate this with a vignette of activity in the organisation leading up to a scheduled evening activity:</p>
<p><em>I was due to participate in an evening session with a group referred to by the workers as the ‘Slovak Lasses’ group. This group was comprised of young Slovak women aged between 15 and 24. The ‘sessions’ all run from 1600 approx until about 1830, and the plan is to run a BBQ event for the attendees. From about 1545, two of the ‘lasses’ had turned up alongside one of the part-time workers and positioned themselves on the end of the row of computers on one wall. They are checking Facebook actively. On another computer, Dean is on Facebook using the charity’s account and has several chat windows open. When prompted, Dean responded that they were “chasing up” the rest of the lasses to make sure that they were coming. As she passed through to go to a meeting elsewhere Andi convinces the two Slovak lasses to accept her taking a photograph of them on her way. Dean signs off the computer at 1630 and returns to the central table. At 1655, there is no sign of the lasses and Dean is visibly concerned, pacing back and forward. He mutters to the room that “we should sack this group”. Sonia agrees looks at me and Dean in turn and then says “this is ridiculous. We have two young people and four staff”. I am dismissed by Dean who turns and says directly to me “You can go if you want. It’s a bit weird if we outnumber the girls and we have loads of staff in”</em></p>
<p>This example illustrates two things which are problematic for the accounting of unproductive labour at the organisation. First, that the unproductive labour required for the execution of the outcome is occasionally hidden and cannot always be inferred from the activity. As we’ve previously discussed, the execution of an event often entails unproductive labour to ensure that it can occur in the first place, and that this is accounted for by the workers through processes of internal task lists or status updates and can be inferred through records of spending generated such as receipts. What is not immediately transparent is the existence of Dean’s task of having to ‘chase up’ the beneficiaries of the event, expending additional effort to make the event possible on top of the labour that has already occurred; and this labour cannot be discovered or revealed by any means that the organisation use to account for time or effort. Second, the outcomes often don’t reflect the scale of the labour input by the workers. Dean spends several hours on the computer engaged in conversation to the lasses, and labour has already been expended organising the event with the attendees prior to the night — whereas only two beneficiaries can be accounted for during the activity. Dean’s utterance of <span><em>“we should sack this group”</em></span> indicates as well that this lack of commitment from the lasses is not an uncommon occurrence and thus that the workers often input labour to the group that is not reflected in how the success of the outcome is measured is problematic. Additionally, Sonia indicates that several staff have committed labour to the event (<span><em>“We have two young people and four staff”</em></span>) which further skews the mapping of input to outcome somewhat when it is accounted for.</p>
<h2 id="discussion-of-findings">Discussion of Findings</h2>
<p>Our findings demonstrate how the charities experience their accountability in terms of their values and labour as individual workers and as an organisation, and how their interactions with technology can shape their interactions with those they are accountable to. We find that the organisation and its workers engage in everyday interactions and processes that they have designed to make themselves accountable by requiring them to justify their actions, and make them answerable <span class="citation">Fox (2007)</span> to each other and their stakeholders in the immediate community. Accountability, and financial transparency, is lived in-the-moment and affected by their relationships as individuals to each other and the communities in which they reside as they respond to their needs <span class="citation">Koppell (2005)</span>.</p>
<p>The ways in which this lived accountability manifests is also subject to the data technologies that can be used to capture practice. We see how accounting for outcomes in charities resembles the practices of storytelling seen in previous HCI studies <span class="citation">Erete et al. (2016)</span>. Meanwhile the only way to capture and account for effective financial practice is to become subject to the transparency measures known to have little impact on work value, namely accounting for spend <span class="citation">Heald (2006)</span>. In this way, both values and effort are hidden to the outside, but can be accounted for to those closest to charity and who benefit directly from its work. As such we see that organisations express their notions of accountability and transparency through the socio-technical systems which are constrained by the characteristics of systems that they have to hand. This in turn implies that systems deployed in this space have signficant effects on how organisations see themselves as being accountable.</p>
<p>Previous work in HCI also proposes new ways for systems to account for the work of organisations in this space <span class="citation">Marshall, Kirk, and Vines (2016)</span> and speaks to the danger of focusing on the flows of financial capital over the organisation’s outcomes. We build upon this discussion now by presenting the ways in which the working practices of those in charities further affect the design of systems that facilitate transparency and accountability with regards to work performed by charities and the value that work has. Whilst the value of ethnographic work should certainly not be limited to providing design implications for systems <span class="citation">Dourish (2006)</span>; our work’s purpose to explore charity working practices and illuminate how these <em>do affect system design</em>. As such we turn now to explicating the characteristics of systems that seek to operate in this space.</p>
<h3 id="hegemonise">Hegemonise</h3>
<p>Workers at charities can often see themselves as being accountable to members of their immediate community for their practice and their spending, as opposed to others who are removed from this work but can stipulate responsibility to document it <span class="citation">Koppell (2005)</span>. Systems put in place by these actors must be engaged with, although we see that working practices can be adjusted to navigate around formalised measures designed to provide accountability. We note in particular that the behaviours workers engage in to become accountable for financial spending could be considered subversive in terms of system design; most noticeably the sharing of access tokens (PINs and debit cards) to personal bank accounts. This touches on prior work in HCI <span class="citation">Vines et al. (2011)</span> which demonstrates how formalised security protocols in systems such as banking are negotiated in settings where there is need for a flexible approach in order to distribute to labour of purchasing securely using social accountability, rather than that imposed by digital systems.</p>
<p>We suggest then that digital systems in this space need to acknowledge and interact with imposed systems and formats, and hegemonise them in addition to this. Hegemonising in this sense refers to the fact that organisations have practices that they have designed to make them accountable to those around them, regardless of the policies and systems imposed from above. Therefore new digital systems in this space should afford organisations the ability to focus on their everyday accountability whilst being able to produce required documentation as a by-product. This allows them to become accountable to those whose opinion they care for <em>in terms that matter to them</em>, whilst remaining accountable ‘on-paper’ and acknowledging the difficulty of affecting policy in this space.</p>
<p>We see this above with subversion of digital accountability in spending, and this must hold true with systems deployed to provide more qualitative accounts. Qualitative accounts can be envisioned as allowing stakeholders to interact with the value, labour and outcomes of the organisation, but mapping this in a system can be problematic. Digital technologies could facilitate data collection and interaction with labour by creating data trails <span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="weiss_digital_2009"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span> or engaging in practices akin to ‘life logging’, but a system that maps this against outcomes may risk devaluing the effort of workers in this space as we see that the mapping of outcomes and labour is not straightforward. In financial matters, it is difficult to represent the thrift of workers when involved in purchasing, or willingness to sacrifice salary for the organisation. In this we see reflected a discussion that measurement of outcome reduces the ability to perceive the work of an organisation <span class="citation">Lowe (2013)</span> that presents a point of tension for the production of more comprehensive account. To address this, digital systems deployed in organisations must hegemonise other processes and formats to allow workers to concentrate on their everyday accountable practices.</p>
<h3 id="federate">Federate</h3>
<p>If we are to produce technologies that allow charities to hegemonise the processes governing their accountability to others, then the systems we deploy must operate in a manner that allows them to function both independently for single tasks as well as considering the wider ecosystem in which they exist. Producing accounts in charities is naturally a federated process whereby multiple systems interact to produce, process, and present accounts and accounting data to a variety of actors. Producing accounts, and facilitating accountability, with digital systems in charities should also be federated in nature.</p>
<p>Where accounting for outcomes and finances occurs in charities, it consists of producing, processing, and then presenting various forms of data. These procedures mirror processes and models discussed by McAuley et al <span class="citation">McAuley, Mortier, and Goulding (2011)</span>, which are notably federated. A federated system could facilitate the capture of heterogenous types of data that are suited for the desires of the organisation, and allow other tools to engage in the processing and presentation of this work. In this way it becomes a kind of <em>federated toolkit</em> that can be used to provide accountability through different views of the organisation based on the format and requirement of the consumer.</p>
<p>To illustrate how we envision the form that these federated toolkits may take, we present some characteristics of them here. We imagine them to be lightweight, heterogeneous, and able to function independently as well as in a federated manner. One can envision a mobile application that captures spending for the user associated with time and location, can share this with a web-based piece of accounting software which may also receive and associate data from other sources such as images or video produced using a variety of other applications. Other actors in this federation could process the same data in other ways, tailored by and for those who desire to use them.</p>
<p>These federated toolkits can provide scability and flexibility for organisations to document their practice, outcomes, and values for others. Imposed transparency measures dictate the format in which work and spending is encapsulated, whereas federated toolkits can allow these to be subverted, navigated and even hegemonised by allowing organisations new ways to capture their work and its value. It also can be envisioned that as the work of the organisation evolves, and engages with new stakeholders, this could facilitate an active form of transparency <span class="citation">Oliver (2004)</span> whereby those interested in an organisation’s work can commission accounts that are meaningful to them based off of the data collected, and request new information that has not been captured to date, making them organisation reflexive and responsive to them.</p>
<h2 id="concluding-remarks">Concluding Remarks</h2>
<p>In this paper we set out to explore how the everyday working practices of charities would affect the design of systems that are deployed in order to make them accountable for their actions and spending. We did this by explicating the how the obligations for a charity to be transparent and accountable are lived and experienced in everyday practice, and how they account for this practice in terms of finances, outcomes and labour. We then discuss how these practices are shaped by the socio-technical systems and technologies that the organisations have access to, and present implications for the design of future systems that facilitate transparency and accountability in charities with regards to their form and operation within everyday practice. We draw out how imposed formats and procedures mean that systems that facilitate new forms of accountability must hegemonise this formats so that charities can subvert these and concentrate on communicating their work and values in terms that matter to them, and how that can be achieved by producing federated toolkits.</p>
<p>Future work for HCI should seek further engaagement with charities to collaborate, develop, deploy and study these systems and how they are appropriated by workers to achieve the goal of operating accountably. The invisibility of labour, and tensions around how this could be presented in relation to outcomes, finances, and values should be considered from the perspectives of both workers and stakeholders in charities. In this way, HCI can address global challenges facing charities and impact the experiences and lives of those who interact with them.</p>
