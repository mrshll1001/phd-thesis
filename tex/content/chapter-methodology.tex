\chapter{Methodology}

\section{Introduction}
This chapter discusses and interrogates the methodologies, approaches, and procedures used in the performance of the research project. It begins by describing the methodological framework that denoted how the project was organised, before turning to how data was collected and subsequently analysed. Finally, the chapter reflects on the mundane performance of the methods as they were affected during the production of the research, and the implications thereof.



\section{Participation and Action Research}
\label{sec:method:approach}

Some intro stuff about action research.


\section{Interactions, Work, and Labour: Approaches to Fieldwork and Analysis}
\label{sec:method:fieldwork}

The research initially set out to understand how digital systems can be used to do stuff with accounts and accountability in charities. 

This section therefore seeks to justify the use of ethnomethodology as the orientation to the fieldwork performed in order to gather data, places the use of workshops within this, and also explores how a Marxist stance on political economy (and to a lesser extent, sociology) also influenced the analysis of fieldwork data and the subsequent design of systems developed as a response to it.
