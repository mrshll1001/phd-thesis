\chapter{Methodology}
\label{sec:method}

This chapter discusses the overall research methodology of the project, before describing the methods used and the analytical lenses applied to data. Coming from a Computer Science background, prior to beginning my MRes with Open Lab in 2014, I had never heard the terms 'Epistemology', or 'Ontology' before. My undergraduate exposure to HCI lead to me understand that there existed different toolkits for performing research with participants, collecting data from it, and analysing this to form knowledge (and systems).

The first meeting of my supervisory team was an incredible eye-opener, as I was suddenly asked to confront my understanding of the very universe itself, and what I understood as a research methodology was very different to the accepted (actual) definition. For example, I thought Action Research was a tool much as Ethnography, not a comprehensive approach bundled with a standpoint on the nature of knowledge.
