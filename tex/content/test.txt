Methodology {#sec:method}
===========

Introduction
------------

This chapter discusses and interrogates the methodologies, approaches,
and procedures used in the performance of the research project. It
begins by describing the methodological framework that denoted how the
project was organised, before turning to how data was collected and
subsequently analysed. Finally, the chapter reflects on the mundane
performance of the methods as they were affected during the production
of the research, and the implications thereof.

Participation and Action Research {#sec:method:approach}
---------------------------------

Some intro stuff about action research.

Interactions, Work, and Labour: Approaches to Fieldwork and Analysis {#sec:method:fieldwork}
--------------------------------------------------------------------

The research initially set out to understand how digital systems can be
used to do stuff with accounts and accountability in charities.

This section therefore justifies the use of ethnomethodology as the
orientation to the fieldwork portions of the research, places the use of
workshops within this, and also explores how a Marxist stance on
political economy (and to a lesser extent, sociology) also influenced
the analysis of fieldwork data and the subsequent design of systems
developed as a response to it.
