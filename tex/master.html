Methodology
1.1   Introduction
This chapter discusses and interrogates the methodologies, approaches, and pro-
cedures used in the performance of the research project. It begins by describing
the methodological framework that denoted how the project was organised, be-
fore turning to how data was collected and subsequently analysed. Finally, the
chapter reflects on the mundane performance of the methods as they were af-
fected during the production of the research, and the implications thereof.

1.3   Interactions, Work, and Labour:  Approaches to
       Fieldwork and Analysis
1.3.1   Ethnomethodological Orientation to Fieldwork
The goal of fieldwork in this research was to provide a corpus of data that could
be used to understand how those operating in the design space (workers at
charitable organisations) reasoned about their work, their finances, and what role
digital technologies played in this. Taking an ethnomethodolgical orientation to
                                                          2                                                 

         
                                                                                                            
         the fieldwork allows the investigation to focus on pragmatics of how accounting
         work is done in charities, how members of these settings engage with each other
         accountably, and thus how organisational Transparency and Accountability are,
         in turn, &#8220;done&#8221; [2, 4]
         Ethnomethodology concerns itself with how members of a social setting organise
         and make sense of their social world; carring very little commitment to particular
         epistemologies or ontologies excepting those that are utilised on a mundane basis
         by the focus of its studies [4, 15].  Further to this, it has been said, however,
         that Ethnomethodology &#8220;carries little or no theoretical baggage&#8221; and consists
         of analytical choices as to what the fieldworker attends to [15]. Its focus on how
         members of a setting construct their reality, however, gives it attitudes rooted
         in Phenomenology&#8217;s description of the Natural Attitude [16].
         Ethnomethodology has a variety of flavours, and has given rise to such practices
         as Conversation Analysis CITATION, SACKS?.  My fieldwork was focused on
         the everyday practices of a setting and as such I consider it an instance of an
         ethnomethodological study of work.
         Following from this, ethnomethodology focuses on how the interactional work
         performed by a setting&#8217;s members is made &#8216;accountable&#8217; to others.
         One notable feature of Ethnomethodology is the &#8216;indifference&#8217; of sociological
         dichotomies such as the question of objectivity vs subjectivity, and instead insists
         that the fieldworker develop a vulgar competence in a setting&#8217;s work to be able
         and describe it in the language of the setting&#8217;s members [2, 15]. In doing so, this
         acknowledges how members of the setting are producing and recognising their
         own contextual structures; and how they are making them mutually intelligible
         or naturally accountable to one another [4, 15].
         Finally, the relationship that ethnomethodologically-informed fieldwork has to
         systems design contexts made it suitable for these enquiries.
1.3.2   Taking a Marxist stance
The performance of the first large portion of fieldwork in the study, beginning
March 2016, overlapped with a series of events in my personal life that began a
pronounced interest in Marxism. This is worth mentioning because the process
resulted in engagment with a host of classic, modern, and academic literatures.
This had a subsequent effect on my reading of fieldwork data with regards to
labour relations of workers, and helped shape the design of systems that were
built in response.
Marxism, and therefore Marxist stances, can be said to be concerned primarily
with the relationships between workers, their labour, capital, and property [6,
17]. The foci offered by Marxism resonated with the research goals in as much
                                                          3                                                 

         
                                                                                                            
         as they were set out to determine in what ways the work of charities related to
         financial capital, and what role technology played in this relationship. Taking a
         Marxist stance meant, to me, orienting myself to how the labour of workers in
         charities was performed; how it was valued, and how it was represented in the
         various types of formal and informal accounts produced at the field site when
         accounting for activity or spending.
         In Marxist theory, the work and value of any organisation, charities included, is
         ultimately derived from the labour of its workers [10]. Classic political economy
         (e.g. [18]) divides labour into the categories of Productive Labour and Unpro-
         ductive Labour. Productive Labour is labour that directly goes into increasing
         the wealth of an organisation, whereas Unproductive Labour is that which does
         not; but is nontheless necessary for the organisation or nation to function [18].
         Marxism is famous for its critique of this classical and arbitrary divide of the pro-
         ductive and unproductive forms of labour; a critique that, in summary, attacks
         the notions of Productive and Unproductive as having no neutral definition; as
         work is not naturally productive and it takes work to make it so [9, 12]. Instead,
         what is seen as Productive or Unproductive is in constant flux and based on a
         multitude of different factors such as the mode of production1, social class, and
         what the &#8216;product&#8217; actually is [12].  When studying charities, this makes sense
         &#8212; taking the classical approach, it would seem as if the only thing within a
         charity that could be called Productive Labour is the act of writing applications
         for grants!
         The Marxist stance on labour assisted in analysis of the fieldwork by providing a
         framework within which I could reason about the findings. Whilst ethnomethod-
         ology allowed for pragmatic insight into the interactional work of the field site
         itself, Marxian critiques of labour grounded these in what was needed to be
         captured to provide insight into design work. Namely, if the distinction between
         Productive  and Unproductive  Labour was based on an arbitrary dilineation,
         where was that line drawn in the field site? How did participants reason about
         what they classed as productive, and how was this accounted for to themselves
         and others?  With Marxism being so closely related to my personal politics,
         I was initially apprehensive about taking this analytical stance.  This anxiety
         was at least partially assuaged when I reflected upon findings of my previous
         study around charities and transparency.  This study discussed that tensions
         around transparency in spending orbited around a focus on bottom line spend-
         ing; leaving out the effort (labour) of volunteers and underplaying importance of
         the labour required of administrative tasks when discussing outcomes; therefore
         emphasising the importance of accounting for the nature of workers&#8217; labour in
         the field site and its relevance to design [7].
         In establishing the relationship between field notes from Ethnomethodologi-
         cal studies and Marxism, it becomes necessary to elaborate on the relation-

         ship between Marxism and Ethnomethodology themselves. Chua explores Eth-
         nomethodology from a Marxist perspective as means in which ideological re-
         production may be investigated, conceiving of ideology as a symptom of social
         knowledge [1].  Ethnomethodology is described as a focus on investigating the
         rational nature of a setting&#8217;s activities and thus providing an analytical tool
         for Marxists to investigate how ideological systems operate as &#8216;natural&#8217; ways
         of knowing and interpreting the world [1].  Freund and Abrams share this sen-
         timent and examine Ethnomethodology&#8217;s treatment of information and social
         perception as linked to the practical interests of those producing them, ther-
         fore showing that social perception and information produced by existing (and
         therefore bourgeouis) institutions, is false [3]. This gives Ethnomethodology and
         Marxism important shared characteristicvs, as both see social knowledge being
         bound to the contexts and methods that produced them, as well as indicating
         that both perspectives fuse theory and praxis [3]. Chua elaborates that the speci-
         ficity and characteristic indifference of Ethnomethodologically-informed studies
         means that results must be appropriated within the wider context of Marxist
         sociology, but that Marxists should otherwise encourage Ethnomethogological
         studies [1].  Conversely, investigating the relevance of Marx to Ethnomethod-
         ology, Mehan and Wood associate Ethnomethodology with a synthesis of both
         the hermeneutic-dialectial, and the logico-empiricist traditions; that whilst the
         methodology of Ethnomethodology is firmly rooted in logico-empricisim, its the-
         ory has derived from hermeneutic-dialectics, and Ethnomethodology&#8217;s alienation
         as a method stems from this transcendancy of its conflicting roots [13]. Marx-
         ism similarly straddles these realms, simultaneously having its philosophical roots
         in Dialectics with the development of Dialectical-Materialism, and possessing
         what is widely regarded as a scientific approach to the investigation of social
         life and political economy [19].   Also of note is the similarity between Eth-
         nomethodology&#8217;s attendence to practical action [2, 4] and Marx&#8217;s thesis that
         &#8220;All social life is essentially practical&#8221; [11].  Indeed, Mehan and Wood argue
         that following the conception of Ethnomethodology, Marx can be viewed as a
         &#8220;crypto-ethnomethodologist&#8221; due to this [13].
         Beyond this, I feel that it is also important to consider that core tenants of
         Ethnomethodology appear to be directly related to Marxist stances on human
         labour.  In Marxism, Labour  is also described as Life Activity; encompassing
         not only participation in economic activity,  but all acts that human beings
         undertake &#8211; from acts of recreation and love,  to tilling fields and designing
         software [8, 14].  It is therefore possible to conceive of the Interactional Work
         attested to by Ethnomethodology [2, 5] as an expression of Labour when viewed
         through a Marxist lense; and reflexively adds the act of organising one&#8217;s social
         reality to the definition of Labour as conceived of in this thesis.
