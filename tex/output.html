<h1 id="sec:method">Methodology</h1>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>This chapter discusses and interrogates the methodologies, approaches, and procedures used in the performance of the research project. It begins by describing the methodological framework that denoted how the project was organised, before turning to how data was collected and subsequently analysed. Finally, the chapter reflects on the mundane performance of the methods as they were affected during the production of the research, and the implications thereof.</p>

<h3 id="ethnomethodological-orientation-to-fieldwork">Ethnomethodological Orientation to Fieldwork</h3>
<p>The goal of fieldwork in this research was to provide a corpus of data that could be used to understand how those operating in the design space (workers at charitable organisations) reasoned about their work, their finances, and what role digital technologies played in this. Taking an ethnomethodolgical orientation to the fieldwork allows the investigation to focus on pragmatics of how accounting work is done in charities, how members of these settings engage with each other accountably, and thus how organisational Transparency and Accountability are, in turn, “done” <span class="citation">Crabtree, Rouncefield, and Tolmie (2012; Garfinkel 1967)</span></p>
<p>Ethnomethodology concerns itself with how members of a social setting organise and make sense of their social world; carring very little commitment to particular epistemologies or ontologies excepting those that are utilised on a mundane basis by the focus of its studies <span class="citation">Randall, Harper, and Rouncefield (2007; Garfinkel 1967)</span>. Further to this, it has been said, however, that Ethnomethodology <span><em>“carries little or no theoretical baggage”</em></span> and consists of analytical choices as to what the fieldworker attends to <span class="citation">Randall, Harper, and Rouncefield (2007)</span>. Its focus on how members of a setting construct their reality, however, gives it attitudes rooted in Phenomenology’s description of the <em>Natural Attitude</em> <span class="citation">Sharrock and Anderson (1986)</span>.</p>
<p>Ethnomethodology has a variety of flavours, and has given rise to such practices as Conversation Analysis . My fieldwork was focused on the everyday practices of a setting and as such I consider it an instance of an <em>ethnomethodological study of work</em>.</p>
<p>Following from this, ethnomethodology focuses on how the interactional work performed by a setting’s members is made ‘accountable’ to others.</p>
<p>One notable feature of Ethnomethodology is the ‘indifference’ of sociological dichotomies such as the question of objectivity vs subjectivity, and instead insists that the fieldworker develop a <em>vulgar competence</em> in a setting’s work to be able and describe it in the language of the setting’s members <span class="citation">Randall, Harper, and Rouncefield (2007; Crabtree, Rouncefield, and Tolmie 2012)</span>. In doing so, this acknowledges how members of the setting are producing and recognising their own contextual structures; and how they are making them mutually intelligible or naturally accountable to one another <span class="citation">Garfinkel (1967; Randall, Harper, and Rouncefield 2007)</span>.</p>
<p>Finally, the relationship that ethnomethodologically-informed fieldwork has to systems design contexts made it suitable for these enquiries.</p>
<h3 id="taking-a-marxist-stance">Taking a Marxist stance</h3>
<p>The performance of the first large portion of fieldwork in the study, beginning March 2016, overlapped with a series of events in my personal life that began a pronounced interest in Marxism. This is worth mentioning because the process resulted in engagment with a host of classic, modern, and academic literatures. This had a subsequent effect on my reading of fieldwork data with regards to labour relations of workers, and helped shape the design of systems that were built in response.</p>
<p>Marxism, and therefore Marxist stances, can be said to be concerned primarily with the relationships between workers, their labour, capital, and property <span class="citation">Singer (2001; Johnson 2012)</span>. The foci offered by Marxism resonated with the research goals in as much as they were set out to determine in what ways the work of charities related to financial capital, and what role technology played in this relationship. Taking a Marxist stance meant, to me, orienting myself to how the labour of workers in charities was performed; how it was valued, and how it was represented in the various types of formal and informal accounts produced at the field site when accounting for activity or spending.</p>
<p>In Marxist theory, the work and value of any organisation, charities included, is ultimately derived from the labour of its workers <span class="citation">Marx (1970)</span>. Classic political economy (e.g. <span class="citation">Smith (1785)</span>) divides labour into the categories of <em>Productive Labour</em> and <em>Unproductive Labour</em>. <em>Productive Labour</em> is labour that directly goes into increasing the wealth of an organisation, whereas <em>Unproductive Labour</em> is that which does not; but is nontheless necessary for the organisation or nation to function <span class="citation">Smith (1785)</span>. Marxism is famous for its critique of this classical and arbitrary divide of the productive and unproductive forms of labour; a critique that, in summary, attacks the notions of <em>Productive</em> and <em>Unproductive</em> as having no neutral definition; as work is not naturally productive and it takes work to make it so <span class="citation">Marx et al. (1974; Marx 1964)</span>. Instead, what is seen as <em>Productive</em> or <em>Unproductive</em> is in constant flux and based on a multitude of different factors such as the mode of production<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>, social class, and what the ‘product’ actually is <span class="citation">Marx et al. (1974)</span>. When studying charities, this makes sense — taking the classical approach, it would seem as if the only thing within a charity that could be called <em>Productive Labour</em> is the act of writing applications for grants!</p>
<p>The Marxist stance on labour assisted in analysis of the fieldwork by providing a framework within which I could reason about the findings. Whilst ethnomethodology allowed for pragmatic insight into the interactional work of the field site itself, Marxian critiques of labour grounded these in what was needed to be captured to provide insight into design work. Namely, if the distinction between <em>Productive</em> and <em>Unproductive</em> Labour was based on an arbitrary dilineation, where was that line drawn in the field site? How did participants reason about what they classed as productive, and how was this accounted for to themselves and others? With Marxism being so closely related to my personal politics, I was initially apprehensive about taking this analytical stance. This anxiety was at least partially assuaged when I reflected upon findings of my previous study around charities and transparency. This study discussed that tensions around transparency in spending orbited around a focus on bottom line spending; leaving out the effort (labour) of volunteers and underplaying importance of the labour required of administrative tasks when discussing outcomes; therefore emphasising the importance of accounting for the nature of workers’ labour in the field site and its relevance to design <span class="citation">Marshall, Kirk, and Vines (2016)</span>.</p>
<p>In establishing the relationship between field notes from Ethnomethodological studies and Marxism, it becomes necessary to elaborate on the relationship between Marxism and Ethnomethodology themselves. Chua explores Ethnomethodology from a Marxist perspective as means in which ideological reproduction may be investigated, conceiving of ideology as a symptom of social knowledge <span class="citation">Chua (1977)</span>. Ethnomethodology is described as a focus on investigating the rational nature of a setting’s activities and thus providing an analytical tool for Marxists to investigate how ideological systems operate as ‘natural’ ways of knowing and interpreting the world <span class="citation">Chua (1977)</span>. Freund and Abrams share this sentiment and examine Ethnomethodology’s treatment of information and social perception as linked to the practical interests of those producing them, therfore showing that social perception and information produced by existing (and therefore bourgeouis) institutions, is false <span class="citation">Freund and Abrams (1976)</span>. This gives Ethnomethodology and Marxism important shared characteristicvs, as both see social knowledge being bound to the contexts and methods that produced them, as well as indicating that both perspectives fuse theory and praxis <span class="citation">Freund and Abrams (1976)</span>. Chua elaborates that the specificity and characteristic indifference of Ethnomethodologically-informed studies means that results must be appropriated within the wider context of Marxist sociology, but that Marxists should otherwise encourage Ethnomethogological studies <span class="citation">Chua (1977)</span>. Conversely, investigating the relevance of Marx to Ethnomethodology, Mehan and Wood associate Ethnomethodology with a synthesis of both the hermeneutic-dialectial, and the logico-empiricist traditions; that whilst the methodology of Ethnomethodology is firmly rooted in logico-empricisim, its theory has derived from hermeneutic-dialectics, and Ethnomethodology’s alienation as a method stems from this transcendancy of its conflicting roots <span class="citation">Mehan and Wood (1975)</span>. Marxism similarly straddles these realms, simultaneously having its philosophical roots in Dialectics with the development of Dialectical-Materialism, and possessing what is widely regarded as a scientific approach to the investigation of social life and political economy <span class="citation">Thomas (2008)</span>. Also of note is the similarity between Ethnomethodology’s attendence to practical action <span class="citation">Garfinkel (1967; Crabtree, Rouncefield, and Tolmie 2012)</span> and Marx’s thesis that <span><em>“All social life is essentially practical”</em></span> <span class="citation">Marx and Engels (1963)</span>. Indeed, Mehan and Wood argue that following the conception of Ethnomethodology, Marx can be viewed as a <span><em>“crypto-ethnomethodologist”</em></span> due to this <span class="citation">Mehan and Wood (1975)</span>.</p>
<p>Beyond this, I feel that it is also important to consider that core tenants of Ethnomethodology appear to be directly related to Marxist stances on human labour. In Marxism, <em>Labour</em> is also described as <em>Life Activity</em>; encompassing not only participation in economic activity, but all acts that human beings undertake – from acts of recreation and love, to tilling fields and designing software <span class="citation">Marx (1844; Mitchell 2013)</span>. It is therefore possible to conceive of the <em>Interactional Work</em> attested to by Ethnomethodology <span class="citation">Garfinkel (2005; Crabtree, Rouncefield, and Tolmie 2012)</span> as an expression of <em>Labour</em> when viewed through a Marxist lense; and reflexively adds the act of organising one’s social reality to the definition of <em>Labour</em> as conceived of in this thesis.</p>
