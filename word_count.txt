Defining what constitutes a charity is problematic because it is a specific form of organisation that belongs to an entire sector or family of organisations which have historically resisted definition. This is largely due to the sheer diversity of both the organisations themselves as well as the legal and social frameworks in which they operate. Even choosing which term to use is problematic not only because any given term can emphasise particular traits of organisations or exclude some organisations entirely, but choosing what term to use will give any discussion a particular national flavour. For example, the term 'Charity Sector' is often used in the UK whereas framing this discussion using the term of 'Non-Profit Organisations' (NPOs) makes it feel distinctly relevant to the USA. However, as noted, these organisations all share a genealogy, which means utilising literature that in turn uses a variety of terms to describe this group of organisations. A working definition of 'a charity' will be outlined at the end of this section.

Charities are a form of Non-Profit Organisation (NPO) which operate within what is often known as the "Third Sector" of the economy; emphasising their separation for public or state-owned operations as well as private for-profit enterprise. The term 'Third Sector', however, is often used interchangeably with others such as "Voluntary Sector", "Independent Sector", "Charitable Sector", or many others. Salamon and Anheier claim that this abundance of definitions often poses a problem, as each term emphasises a particular characteristic of these organisations whilst downplaying others -- which can be misleading when attempting to describe them. An example of this would be how the term "Voluntary Sector" emphasises the contributions of volunteers in the operation of the organisations, at the expense of organisations or activities that are performed by paid employees. Frumkin prefers the term "Non-Profit and Voluntary Sector" for this reason.

This diversity of organisations within the "Third Sector" means that a general definition is difficult to generate, however Salamon and Anheier go some way to provide one based off of the structural or operational characteristics of the organisations; which would therefore allow their definition to cater for the sector's diversity of legal structures, funding mechanisms, and function. Their definition identifies five base characteristics common to the organisations (they use the term NPOs). These organisations are: "Formal", having been constituted or institutionalised legally to some extent; "Private", meaning they are institutionally separate from government; "Non-Profit distributing", where any profits generated by activities are reinvested directly into the 'basic mission of the agency' instead of being distributed to owners or directors; "Self-governing", with their own internal protocols or procedures as opposed to being controlled directly by external entities; and "Voluntary", where the organisation's activities or management involves a meaningful degree of voluntary participation.

Frumkin gives three characteristics of these organisations which align with Salamon and Anheier's framework. The organisations: do not coerce participation (ie they do not have a monopoly and interacting with them is optional); their profits are not given to stakeholders; and they lack clear lines of ownership and accountability. These definitions are not without issue, as they notably exclude various quasi-commercial entities such as those found in the UK -- ie Building Societies and Cooperatives.

It is the exclusion of such entities that presents an issue for achieving a working definition. Lohmann calls for a more expansive view of the "Nonprofit Organisation" since definitions often account only for those legally bound by particular legislation and that if academics work only within these confines then they are limited in their attention. Lohmann also takes issue with the term "Third Sector" as it often is not presented in context of what it is a sector of. Lohmann argues that the organisations generally included in definitions of the "Third Sector" are actually simply a part of a broader grouping termed the "Social Economy" which would include NPOs and Charities but also others such as cooperatives and member organisations.
