Like any organisation, charities experience a set of pressures dependent on their circumstances, with the heterogeneity of the sector meaning that each individual organisation will be subject to unique pressures. Generally, however, it is understood that there are a range of pressures that operate on charities and the TSSE across the board.

Traditionally, NPOs have embraced values such as philanthropy and voluntarism in order to advocate for, and to provide the means for, services to their client-base. Social Enterprise and Social Entrepreneurship have risen as a response to these challenges faced by NPOS today . Dart broadly describes Social Enterprise as \quoteit{significantly influenced by business thinking and by a primary focus on results and outcomes for client groups and communities} , Dees states that Social Enterprise \quoteit{combines the passion of a social mission with an image of business-like discipline} . In practice, this often includes activities and practices that include revenue-source diversification, fee-for-service programs, and partnerships with the private sector .

Social Enterprise, whilst often regarded as a miracle solution \cite{dart_legitimacy_2004, harding_social_2004, dees_meaning_1998}, is not without criticism. Eikenberry writes that NPOs, focusing on bottom-line expenditure and adopting a social enterprise model actually poses a threat to civil society . She argues that the on the bottom line and overhead expenditures forcing NPOs to embrace market values and entrepreneurial attitudes, and changing the way that they operate has been detrimental. Dart claims that Social Enterprise differs traditional NPOs as they generally \quoteit{blur boundaries} between nonprofit and for-profit activities, and even enact \quoteit{hybrid} activities . This could include activities such as engaging with marketing contracts as opposed to accepting donations, as well as behaviour such as cutting services that are not deemed to be cost-effective . Implications of industry funded NPOs notwithstanding , the shift of effort from effective service delivery to financial strategy impacts negatively on the social capital that is generated. This is through less emphasis on building relationships with stakeholders (previously an essential survival strategy) as service users become framed as consumers, and through market pressures diverting resources towards skills such as project management and away from activities that build social capital . Doherty et al. echo this in their description of Social Enterprises, distinguishing them from traditional NPOs by stating that the latter are \quoteit{more likely to remain dependent on gifts and grants rather than developing true paying customers} .

As actors within social networks themselves, charities and TSSEs also need to make use of Social Capital in addition to their pivotal role in producing and sustaining it for others. King writes that charities and TSSEs were formed using Social Capital and part of their role is to "sustain and broaden" it in order to provide opportunities and make the mundane operation of an organisation smoother. She writes that those in leadership positions within an organisation draw upon techniques such as networking and skills development in order to allow the organisation to perform its work and meet its goals -- calling charities and TSSEs (she uses the term nonprofits) "the epitome of Social Capital in action" as the organisations can not only utilise but spread their Social Capital to others. Swanson shares these sentiments and explicates that strategic engagement of an organisation's Social Capital should be a central tenant in its management and leadership, Fredette and Bradshaw echo this and discuss how bonding capital established between those in leadership roles allows them to collectively mobilise through the sharing of information and the building of trust.

Trust is inextricably tied to Social Capital, as Field discusses that a network with high trust levels operates more efficiently than one with comparably lower levels of trust. This means that in order for a charity and TSSE actor to achieve its goals more effectively, it must be trusted. Whilst it is important to note that there is some disagreement as to the exact nature of Trust within Social Capital ie whether Trust is a product or instigator of Social Capital; it remains that high levels of Trust allows an organisation to operate more effectively, and continue the cycle of production and sustenance of Social Capital for their stakeholders. Schneier writes on Trust that it is essential for society at large to function (e.g. we trust in our currency, we trust in our qualifications etc.), although on-the-ground Trust plays a key role in accessing resources in the social network, since a transaction between two trusting actors is less expensive (both in terms of emotional labour and financial capital) to faciliate than a similar transaction between two actors lacking trust. Trust, therefore, is an important factor for charities and TSSEs in the performance of their work as lack of Trust will impede an organisation as much as high Trust will aid them.
