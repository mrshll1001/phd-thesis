This section explores Transparency and Accountability in the context of Charities and the TSSE. This is done so that we may understand the mechanisms by which these organisations may become more trustworthy to their stakeholders, facilitating not only their daily operation (as discussed above) but in doing so; continue producing value for society at large.

In understanding the roles that organisational Transparency and Accountability may play in this, we situate the research as operating within these spaces in order to provide a foundational understanding from which to begin working.

Transparency and Accountability are seen as increasingly desirable traits in governments and organisations, and have moved over the last century from intellectual ideas in the wings to playing a central role across the globe. Correa et al say of Transparency and Open Government that it is "synonymous with efficient and collaborative government", and Steele writes that "Transparency is the new app that launches civilization 2.0". However, the terms are still ambiguous. Hood writes that Transparency is "more often preached than practiced [and] more often invoked than defined". This section therefore aims to explore various definitions of 'Transparency'.

Historically, Transparency was inherent in the actions and interactions of everyday society since, in traditional societies, the density of social networks made one's actions highly visible. Meijer contrasts this with modern societies where "people do not know each other -- many people in cities do not even know their neighbours" and argues that societies which operate at a larger scale suffer a decline in social control, which calls for new forms of Transparency that match the scale of the society. The term Transparency has been a watch-word for governance since the late 20th century, yet its roots stretch back much further. Hood identifies three `strains' of pre-20th-century thought that are at least partial predecessors to Transparency's modern doctrine: rule-governed administration; candid and open social communication; and ways of making organisation and society `knowable'.

The first of these "strains" of thought, Rule-governed administration, is the idea that government should operate in accordance to fixed and predictable rules and, and Hood calls it the "one of the oldest ideas in political thought" WRITE MORE HERE. The second strain, Candid and Open social communication, had its early proponents liken Transparency to one's "natural state", and it saw an implementation in the `town meeting' method of governance where members of the town would deliberate in the presence of one another -- making all deals transparent and ensuring all parties were mutually accountable. The third of form of proto-Transparency doctrines, is the notion the social world can be made 'knowable' through methods or techniques that act as counterparts to studying natural or physical phenomena. Hood describes an 18th-century "police science" which exposed the public to view through the introduction of street lighting or open spaces, as well as the publication of information (all of which designed to help prevent crime).

When viewed in this historical context, from these different perspectives, it can be said that Transparency is inherently concerned with information; access to it, and effective use of it. Oliver describes Transparency as having three key components: something (or someone) to be observed; someone to observe it; and the means supporting such an observation. Heald discusses how these first two components can manifest in modern Transparencies with a property of directionality; a direction being an indicator of who is visible to whom. Heald conceptualises four directions of Transparency that exist across two axis: Upwards and Downwards; Inwards and Outwards.

The 'vertical' axis (Upwards and Downwards) refers to position in a given hierarchy, such as found within an organisation or a nation. An Upwards Transparency would indicate that those higher in a hierarchy can observe the conduct, behaviour or actions of those below them, whilst Downwards Transparency would mean that those higher on the ladder are made observable by those below them. The 'horizontal' axis (Inwards and Outwards) refers to relative position to an organisation and whether one can observe or be observed by it. An Inwards Transparency would mean that those external to an organisation may see into it, and conversely an Outwards Transparency would denote situations wherein an organisation may peer 'out' and monitor its habitat or other actors.

These forms of Transparency can (and often do) coexist simultaneously in a given situation, and any combination. Further to this, operation of a direction across one axis does not preclude the existence of its counterpart. For example, there may be a situation which can be described as possessing both Upwards and Downwards Transparencies. When this occurs Heald describes that axis as having "symmetry". Real world examples can be analysed in this manner; a government's surveillance of its citzens (or a private company's surveillance of its workers) can be described as a combination of Downwards and Outwards Transparencies. The inverse of this situation, Upwards and Inwards, has also been encapsulated with the term 'Sousveillance' -- a term coined by Mann meaning "to watch from below". Mann gives two possible interpretations of the term Sousveillance. The first, as discussed, is an inversion of Surveillance formed by Upwards and Inwards Transparencies allowing citizens to capture abuses of power by those in positions of authority such e.g. by police officers at street level. The second interpretation of Sousveillance specifically refers to the relative positions of cameras in physical space such as the proliferation of cameras attached to modern smartphones. It can be argued that this has enabled the first form of Sousveillance, and that abuses of power that have always occurred and that they are only now being witnessed en masse. However, with the advent of digital monitoring endorsed by governments and corporate bodies, and the possibilities of these actors utilising citizenry's smartphones -- this means that Sousveillance can also have implications for the Downwards and Outwards forms Transparency discussed in the context of traditional surveillance. In addition to this, Ganascia also discusses how an increased desire for access to public information has lead to aspirations for "total transparency", which ion the US has resulted in government endorsement of data sharing (Sometimes called 'Open Government' or 'Government 2.0'). There have been similar moves in the UK (e.g. data.gov.uk) which are designed to improve the delivery and transparency of public services.

The sharing of data, however, does not constitute the entirety of Transparency. As discussed, the historical context of Transparency appears concerned with two aspects of information; access to it is indeed one of these, however the effective use of such data is also an important factor. Schauer writes of Transparency that it cannot be simply equated with knowledge, and at best facilitates it. For information or processes to be Transparent he defines the criteria of being "open and available for scrutiny", but this definition notably lacks an explanation how groups or individuals may make use of information, and the cost for them to access it. Hood also acknowledges this as a tension between the historical "Town Hall" forms of Transparency, related to Candid and Open Social Communication, and its distant cousin concerned with accounting and book-keeping.

It is this concern with accounting and book-keeping that is most often associated with Transparency in common parlance. In this context there are also distinct flavours of Transparency that must be acknowledged. In government and business, Transparency has taken the form of releasing information concerned with accounts and expenditure on a regular or semi-regular basis. Oliver discusses how this is an older form of Transparency and almost purely reactive -- often in response to a scandal. Further to this, Oliver writes that the Old Transparency is giving way to what he calls the 'New Transparency', which is more proactive and the taking on a stance of "active disclosure". Similar to Oliver, Schauer provides a discussion on the dualistic nature of Transparency divided across the same lines of passiveness vs activity -- to the point where he names the twin forms of Transparency "Passive Transparency" and "Active Transparency". From this point, Oliver and Schauer's discussions converge along similar lines. Old and Passive Transparency is concerned only with information being made available "for others to see if they so choose, or perhaps think to look, or have the time, means and skills to look"; which resembles the discussion that definitions of Transparency often don't consider how stakeholders may access or understand information about an actor. New and Active Transparency is not only demanding, but concerned with information's interpretation and access and should be thought of as of communication concerned with the organisation's responsibilities. Heald discusses a very similar division of Transparency which he calls "Nominal Transparency" vs "Effective Transparency". The term "Nominal Transparency" describes something similar to the Old and Passive Transparencies outlined by both Oliver and Schauer, but more ominious. Heald says that whilst Transparency of any given organisation may increase on an index, there is a divergence with Effective Transparency to the point where it is Transparency only in name -- creating an illusion of Transparency. For Transparency to be effective, Heald writes that there must be receptors capable of receiving, processing, and utilising the information.

Heald's dichotomy between Nominal and Effective Transparency sits alongside two other similar dichotomies that he describes as being important factors to discussion of the term: Real-Time vs Retrospective Transparencies; and Event vs Process Transparencies. The first dichotomy deals with the variable of time in the availability of information as a Real-Time Transparency would take a form of continuous surveillance such as that enabled by modern technologies such as CCTV or (a little less odious) open data apis which are continuously fresh. Retrospective Transparency describes a reporting cycle during which an organisation operates and then prepares an account of activity.
