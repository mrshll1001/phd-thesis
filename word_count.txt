Like any organisation, charities experience a set of pressures dependent on their circumstances, with the heterogeneity of the sector meaning that each individual organisation will be subject to unique pressures. Generally, however, it is understood that there are a range of pressures that operate on charities and the TSSE across the board.

As of writing, in the UK we have experienced nearly a decade of austerity politics which has resulted in significant reduction of funding to national services as well as Local Government Organisations (known as Councils). The result of this is that Charities and the TSSE are having to supply people with the services that they require either independently providing services that were once provided by the Councils, or working as a contracted official supplier of a service once provided "in-house". At the same time, the change in national leadership associated with the austerity agenda has lead to uncertainty in UK charities securing adequate funding to meet their needs as government grants are reduced or disappear entirely.

In response to this shifting environment, many charities and TSSE organisations are switching their operational model to that of a Social Enterprise (SE) or Social Entrepreneurship in general. SEs are yet again, a diverse set of organisations, but one that specifically combines brings in business-like elements, activities and structures from the For-Profit sector and applies them to activities that are intended for social betterment and benefit to society; much like traditional charities and TSSE organisations. Dart broadly describes Social Enterprise as "significantly influenced by business thinking and by a primary focus on results and outcomes for client groups and communities", and Dees states that Social Enterprise combines the passion of a social mission with an image of business-like discipline. In practice, this often includes activities and practices that include revenue-source diversification, fee-for-service programs, and partnerships with the private sector. Defourny and Nyssens describe the rise of SEs across the world, and that the UK has used the SE 'brand' within policy documents for years, and give as part of the working definition that the organisations profits are "principally reinvested for [a social mission] in the business or community, rather than being driven by the need to maximise profit for shareholders and owners". This definition shares similarities to that for charities and TSSEs discussed earlier in the review -- however distinctly does not include the requirement that profits cannot be distributed to shareholders, only that they principally are used primarily towards an organisation's social mission.

SEs often cited as a solution to the issues being experienced by charities and the TSSE, but it is not without criticism. Eikenberry writes that organisations adopting a social enterprise model actually poses a threat to civil society. She argues that change in model leads to a focus on the bottom line and overhead expenditures, and exposes them to market forces that they would otherwise be sheltered from. Aside from the effects on the organisation itself, this exposure means organisations can often adopt "market values" and "entrepreneurial attitudes" which means that the change in their operational model is detrimental to society. Dart elaborates that SEs differ from traditional NPOs as they generally blur boundaries between nonprofit and for-profit activities, and even enact "hybrid" activities. This could include activities such as engaging with marketing contracts as opposed to accepting donations, as well as behaviour such as cutting services that are not deemed to be cost-effective. Whilst there are large implications for organisations accepting funding from for-profit industries, a major implication of changing operational model is that the shift of effort from effective service delivery to financial strategy impacts negatively on the Social Capital that is generated. This is through less emphasis on building relationships with stakeholders (previously an essential survival strategy) as service users become framed as consumers, and through market pressures diverting resources towards skills such as project management and away from activities that build Social Capital. Doherty et al. echo this in their description of Social Enterprises, distinguishing them from traditional models of charities and TSSE organisation by stating that the latter are "more likely to remain dependent on gifts and grants rather than developing true paying customers". Eikenberry's concerns are manifest here, as the service user or "beneficiary" of an organisation becomes reframed as a "customer" due to the influence of market forces.

Social Capital plays a significant role in the success of a charity or TSSE organisation. As actors within social networks themselves, these organisations need to make use of Social Capital in addition to their pivotal role in producing and sustaining it for others. King writes that charities and TSSEs were formed using Social Capital and part of their role is to "sustain and broaden" it in order to provide opportunities and make the mundane operation of an organisation smoother. She writes that those in leadership positions within an organisation draw upon techniques such as networking and skills development in order to allow the organisation to perform its work and meet its goals -- calling charities and TSSEs (she uses the term nonprofits) "the epitome of Social Capital in action" as the organisations can not only utilise but spread their Social Capital to others. Swanson shares these sentiments and explicates that strategic engagement of an organisation's Social Capital should be a central tenant in its management and leadership, Fredette and Bradshaw echo this and discuss how bonding capital established between those in leadership roles allows them to collectively mobilise through the sharing of information and the building of trust.

Trust is inextricably tied to Social Capital, as Field discusses that a network with high trust levels operates more efficiently than one with comparably lower levels of trust. This means that in order for a charity and TSSE actor to achieve its goals more effectively, it must be trusted. Whilst it is important to note that there is some disagreement as to the exact nature of Trust within Social Capital ie whether Trust is a product or instigator of Social Capital; it remains that high levels of Trust allows an organisation to operate more effectively, and continue the cycle of production and sustenance of Social Capital for their stakeholders. Schneier writes on Trust that it is essential for society at large to function (e.g. we trust in our currency, we trust in our qualifications etc.), although on-the-ground Trust plays a key role in accessing resources in the social network, since a transaction between two trusting actors is less expensive (both in terms of emotional labour and financial capital) to faciliate than a similar transaction between two actors lacking trust. Trust, therefore, is an important factor for charities and TSSEs in the performance of their work as lack of Trust will impede an organisation as much as high Trust will aid them.
