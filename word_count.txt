The purpose of Transparency is to support and engender trust in an individual an organisation; to see what they are doing so that we may hold them to account if they act in a way that society deems inappropriate. Transparency is therefore designed to ensure the Accountability of actors in positions of responsibility or in power. The imposition of Transparency measures or regulations is often seen as tantamount to providing means to ensuring Accountability; however, as discussed above, for something to be Transparent requires more than the provision of information. The same is true of Accountability, and whilst the term is often used interchangeably with Transparency the word has its own definitions that are similarly nuanced and at once both intertwined with and separate from Transparency.

Koppel states of Accountability that "[to layer] every imagines meaning of accountability into a single definition would render the concept meaningless" and thus explicitly avoids trying to provide a universal definition of the term. Instead, Koppel produces a five-dimensional "topology" in order to facilitate discussion of the term within different contexts; stating that one's definition of Accountability will revolve around the beliefs held around the ideal relationships between various actors. The five dimensions of Koppel's typology are: Transparency; Liability; Controllability; Responsibility; and Responsiveness. Similar to the directionality of Transparency, these dimensions are not mutually exclusive and may exist simultaneous to another in a given context.

The first two dimensions of the typology are described as "foundational", in that they support the concepts found within the other dimensions. The first of these is Transparency; the requirement for an actor to account for its actions and thus (potentially) its mistakes. Koppel discusses this as the most important instrument for assessing organisational performance and is simultaneously a critical tool as well as a goal unto itself. As a component of Accountability, Transparency is concerned with whether an organisation revealed the facts of its performance. The second foundational dimension of Accountability in the framework is Liability. Liability is the dimension that describes an actor's requirement to face consequences for its actions, making them culpable. Liability is often discussed in terms of punishing actions that are deemed to be malpractice, although it should be noted that it can also involve rewarding good practice.

Koppel's framework lists Controllability as the third dimension of Accountability. Controllability is the ability for one actor to control the actions of another, such that if X can induce or control the actions of Y; then Y is Accountable to X. According to this, an organisation can be said to be Accountable if its principal's commands are followed. In government this expresses itself in various forms throughout democratic processes -- governments are supposed to be controlled by citizenry as elected officials are representative of the will of the people. In a similar vein, these officials are also often said to be Liable as they may be punished at the end of their term by a public who may choose to elect another in their place.

The fourth dimension of Accountability is Responsibility. Responsibility denotes adherence to principles, regulations, laws, and standards designed to control organisations that are not necessarily directly controllable by a principal composed of a collective or public will.

The fifth and final dimension Koppel uses to describe Accountability is Responsiveness. Similar to Responsibility, this sidesteps the need for a hierarchical structure as it describes the organisation's attention to the concerns, needs, or demands of its constituents or clients as opposed to the will of elected officials. Generally, it is understood that for-profit organisations must be Responsive or they will die, whereas a Non-Profit organisation may be held accountable for its actions if it is deemed to not be appropriately meetings the needs of its service users.
