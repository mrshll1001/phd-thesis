Kaye et al demonstrate that people interact with money and their personal finances with at least three different facets. The first of these is at an emotional level; as individuals may make decisions that do not appear 'rational' from a purely financial perspective but are instead driven by other factors such as personal history or experience with debt. The second facet is a form of management of 'pots' of money. In this context, money is not treated as a single entity but divided up along lines such as origin or intended use, and people use a variety of self-made or adaptable tools (both digital and analogue) in order to achieve this management; such as folders, notebooks, and spreadsheets. Finally, dealing with the unknown or 'higher powers' is an important facet of people's relationships with money as they may lack important information held about them; such as their current Credit Scores (often used as a measure of financial health in the US), and they understand that their personal futures may contain events that they have not financially planned or accounted for.
