Charities are seemingly inherently valued by most individuals in civil society. The social motivations behind Charities and the wide variety of activities in which they involve themselves, as well as the manner of their involvement often means that the health of the Third Sector and Social Economy (TSSE) are often used as barometers for the health of civic society. This thesis therefore seeks to explore the importance of Charities and the TSSE to society in order to understand better the world in which they operate.

Hannsman writes on the role of Charities and the TSSE that they often emerge from a "contract failure" of the market to police the producers of services, and that it is very rare to find Charities operating in industrial sectors. According to Hansmann, economic theory dictates that the failure is in accordance with consumers (as a group rather than individuals) to do one of the following: accurately compare providers; reach agreement  as to the price and quality of services to be exchanged; and to assess the compliance of the organisation to their part of the deal, obtaining redress if the organisation is seen to have not complied. Charities and TSSE Organisations emerge, therefore, when this process has failed to regulate For-Profit actors in any given economic activity: "The reason is simply that contributors [to a for-profit business] would  have little or no assurance that their payments â€¦ were actually needed to pay for the service they received". As noted, it is uncommon to find Charities and TSSEs operating in industrial sectors, and as such the services offered by these organisations can often be those that involve a separation between the purchaser of a service and the eventual recipient; e.g. the purchase and transport of food aid overseas. The inability of Charities to distribute profits to shareholders thus removes the incentive and power of organisations to reduce direct spend on the service; reassuring the purchaser that their money is not for the direct profit of shareholders.

Salamon writes that Charities and TSSEs "deliver human services, promote grass-roots economic development, prevent environmental degradation, protect civil rights, and pursue a thousand other objectives formerly unattended or left to the state". This insight reinforces Hansmann's view that the activities of these organisations are concerned primarily with provision of services unattended to by For-Profit sectors. Salamon's statement also implies the presence of State actors in a given activity and that State-provided services would mean that there is no requirement for a Charity actor if the needs of the people were being met. Frumkin argues that a core part of the TSSE is that it is responsive to demand; specifically the demands of a public who have unmet needs. Not only does Frumkin's argument add weight to both Hannsman and Salamon's admonition that the For-Profit sector is either unconcerned or untrusted with particular activities, but also that the State is either an absentee actor or that the service provided is unsatisfactory in meeting the needs of the Public.

The nature and scope of activities in which Charities and the TSSE are involved are incredibly diverse. Salamon and Anheir outline a classification system, the International Classification of Nonprofit Organisations (ICNPO), that divides and classifies organisations into 12 groups based on economic activity, with an additional 24 sub-groups. Whilst this classification system generally only provides high-level descriptors of organisations, lacking detail on the nature of how activities are performed pragmatically on-the-ground, they offer a starting point from which to begin to understand the far-reaching and diverse nature of the TSSE's activities. Examples range from "Nursing Homes" and "Mental Health and Crisis intervention", to "Housing" and "Culture and Arts".

The activities undertaken by Charities and the TSSE are also important to society because they are generally understood to produce and sustain Social Capital. Social Capital is a term used to describe
