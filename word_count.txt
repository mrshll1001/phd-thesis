In the context of charities, Erete et al explore how NPOs use Open Data technologies to support their practice. Data is largely used to create a narrative and engage in a story-telling practice around particular goals which differ in context -- e.g. making grant applications, or internal management functions. Organisations are shown to combine multiple sources of data into a narrative, as well as being able to derive multiple narratives from a single data set. Further to this, they discuss how NPOs operate with limited resources and as such may benefit from services such as Data Portals to enable them to acquire data easily to produce these valuable narratives, and put forward that additional value is created via such portals when they act to build or strengthen relationships between those seeking to use the data and those possessing skills or knowledge around its analysis. From the perspective of Transparency and Accountability, it stands to reason that systems can be developed that allows charities (NPOs) to engage actively in the data collection process, and allow them to construct multiple, and varied narratives from personal data sets that can be used in similar contexts to those described by Erete et al -- ie supporting grant applications and internal management procedures, but also additional cases such as evidencing their work by retrieving and presenting information collected about it.

HCI research has previously concerned itself with investigating the ways in which can facilitate people's interactions around money. At the individual scale, this has occurred through studies investigating how people manage personal finances in particular circumstances, as well as how people engaged with money on an experiential level. At larger scales, HCI has also taken into account the social world around financial transactions to theorise around the design of potential future payment systems; and alternative forms of capital such as cryptocurrencies and the surrounding Blockchain technologies have accountability baked into the infrastructure of the systems themselves.

At the community Scale, Ferreira et al explored the social world surrounding money, specifically a community currency known as the Bristol Pound. Their work discusses how exchanges of money using the currency shared aspects of a conversation, as the transactors would engage in social interactions that were unbounded by the settings roles such as 'shopkeeper' and 'customer', prompted by the technology use required to pay with the currency. Further to this, the use of the shared currency (and the technological systems supporting it) gave the transactors an indication of shared values and interests.

Crowdfunding websites such as Kickstarter offer options wherein donators to a particular fund may have their donation returned if, for example, the total requested amount of donations has not been met. Beltran et al extend this concept further with their deployment of `Codo` which they describe as "Fundraising with Conditional Donations". In this deployment, Beltran et al describe how they developed a logical grammar which allows a donor on the system to more richly prescribe (or describe) the conditions of their donation, such as matching funds from other individuals or those within a defined group. Whilst this system does not proffer much in the way of exploring how organisations can report back on their expenditure, it presents the case that conditions may be put forward and codified as a means of providing a rudimentary accountability; as an organisation may need to attract the support of more than disparate groups in order to receive their donations. This opens up the possibility that a system may be developed with an 'accountability spin', where conditions are put upon funds by Funding bodies that request reimbursement under the event that conditions that they set out are not adequately met.
