The purpose of Transparency is to support and engender trust in an individual an organisation; to see what they are doing so that we may hold them to account if they act in a way that society deems inappropriate. Transparency is therefore designed to ensure the Accountability of actors in positions of responsibility or in power. The imposition of Transparency measures or regulations is often seen as tantamount to providing means to ensuring Accountability; however, as discussed above, for something to be Transparent requires more than the provision of information. The same is true of Accountability, and whilst the term is often used interchangeably with Transparency the word has its own definitions that are similarly nuanced and at once both intertwined with and separate from Transparency.

Koppel states of Accountability that "[to layer] every imagines meaning of accountability into a single definition would render the concept meaningless" and thus explicitly avoids trying to provide a universal definition of the term. Instead, Koppel produces a five-dimensional "topology" in order to facilitate discussion of the term within different contexts; stating that one's definition of Accountability will revolve around the beliefs held around the ideal relationships between various actors. The five dimensions of Koppel's typology are: Transparency; Liability; Controllability; Responsibility; and Responsiveness. Similar to the directionality of Transparency, these dimensions are not mutually exclusive and may exist simultaneous to another in a given context.

The first two dimensions of the typology are described as "foundational", in that they support the concepts found within the other dimensions. The first of these is Transparency; the requirement for an actor to account for its actions and thus (potentially) its mistakes. Koppel discusses this as the most important instrument for assessing organisational performance and is simultaneously a critical tool as well as a goal unto itself. As a component of Accountability, Transparency is concerned with whether an organisation revealed the facts of its performance. The second foundational dimension of Accountability in the framework is Liability. Liability is the dimension that describes an actor's requirement to face consequences for its actions, making them culpable. Liability is often discussed in terms of punishing actions that are deemed to be malpractice, although it should be noted that it can also involve rewarding good practice.

More has been said about the relationship between Transparency and Accountability. Fox writes that it is often assumed that Transparency generated Accountability, although this is not always the case. He elaborates the question that one should ask is in fact "What forms of Transparency generate which forms of Accountability?". Fox describes two forms of Transparency: "Clear" and "Fuzzy", which align somewhat with Heald's dichotomy of "Nominal" and "Effective" Transparencies described earlier; with Clear Transparency being the provider of reliable information contrasted with "Fuzzy" Transparency's provision of useless, inaccurate, or irrelevant details either as an act of subversion by a malicious actor, or a problem with the measure used to impose Transparency.

According to Fox, different forms of Accountability are produced under given circumstances (as also described by Koppel), however he notes that if an organisation is only Nominally Transparent, then they are not Accountable at all. A Clear and Effective Transparency overlaps with a form of Accountability Fox describes as "Soft"; which produces an "answerability" giving the public the capability to demand answers or justification for actions. This is contrasted with "Hard Accountability"; a form that includes answerability in addition for the power to impose sanctions on those acting inappropriately. These shadow Koppel's framework, as the sanctions imposed in a Hard Accountability would make an organise Liable, whereas answerability may exist as a manifestation of other aspects of the framework.

Hood cites answerability as a reason why the terms Transparency and Accountability go hand-in-hand, as the ability to produce answers implies the sharing of information, and says that this is the "Siamese Twins" conception of the terms. Another conception offered by Hood is that they are often considered "matching parts" that are separate but interlocking, allowing the popular opinion to form that whilst both are necessary for good governance; there are no tradeoffs to be made. Hood challenges this and says that Transparency and Accountability may also be deemed "Awkward bedfellows", in that an effective Accountability and all variants of Transparency do not always go hand-in-hand.

Koppel's framework lists Controllability as the third dimension of Accountability. Controllability is the ability for one actor to control the actions of another, such that if X can induce or control the actions of Y; then Y is Accountable to X. According to this, an organisation can be said to be Accountable if its principal's commands are followed. In government this expresses itself in various forms throughout democratic processes -- governments are supposed to be controlled by citizenry as elected officials are representative of the will of the people. In a similar vein, these officials are also often said to be Liable as they may be punished at the end of their term by a public who may choose to elect another in their place. The level of Controllability can also vary, and there is not a linear relationship to determine whether more Controllability is desirable in a given context. Romzek and Ingraham denote that a dimension of Accountability is "autonomy", which fits into the paradigm of Controllability as described by Koppel. The suitable degree of autonomy (and thus Controllability) afforded to an actor may differ depending on a number of factors.

The fourth dimension of Accountability is Responsibility. Responsibility denotes adherence to principles, regulations, laws, and standards designed to control organisations that are not necessarily directly controllable by a principal composed of a collective or public will. Romzek and Ingraham describe two forms of Accountability in line with this, called "Legal" (adherence to law) and "Professional" (deference to expert judgement). The fifth and final dimension Koppel uses to describe Accountability is Responsiveness. Similar to Responsibility, this sidesteps the need for a hierarchical structure as it describes the organisation's attention to the concerns, needs, or demands of its constituents or clients as opposed to the will of elected officials. Generally, it is understood that for-profit organisations must be Responsive or they will die, whereas a Non-Profit organisation may be held accountable for its actions if it is deemed to not be appropriately meetings the needs of its service users. It can be argued that Responsibility and Responsiveness fall into the category of Soft Accountability described by Fox, as legal frameworks and engagement with service users may produce a form of answerability, in contrast to the harder forms produced when organisations are Liable.

Finally, Koppel's framework outlines something termed "Multiple Accountability Disorder" (MAD), which occurs when an actor experiences multiple and conflicting forms forms of accountability, leading to cases where no forms of accountability are satisfied with the actor in question. Koppel writes that "Organizations are often expected to be accountable -- implicitly or explicitly -- in every sense". Romzek and Ingraham conceptualise this as 'managerial cross-pressures'; and explain that an actor within an organisation may be accountable to sources both internal and external to an organisation which can lead to an explicit conflict. As an example Professional Accountability (deference to expert judgement) may be in direct conflict with rules internal to an organisation, or against the wishes of an electorate in the context of Responsiveness. Aspects of Accountability may also be in conflict with themselves ie a responsibility to satisfy obligations to established commitments may be in conflict with overcoming a particular challenge in the present, or multiple other actors may be able to Control an organisation and order it to conflicting action. In a charity context, it is feasible that an organisation may act in ways that are deemed irresponsible when concerning professional standards, but may be acting in response to the needs of its beneficiaries and.
